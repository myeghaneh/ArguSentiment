The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I\\'ll elaborate more here. Technically it\\'s a two-part view:\\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\\n\\nI\\'d be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I\\'d probably change my mind on view 2. (It\\'ll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 – I’m not certain that it’s a worthwhile endeavor.)\\n\\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There\\'s an unfortunate tendency that I’ve noticed – particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well – to blame the victims of terrible situations. We’re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn’t have been so drunk, or you shouldn’t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don’t deserve it. We like to think of our world as “just” in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people “Deserved” what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman “deserved” to be raped, but there’s a certain amount of “otherization” and lack of empathy that goes on – a sense that “well, that wouldn’t have happened to me, because I would’ve been more careful”. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that’s all bad.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism – overt or structural – and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I’m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur – A and B – and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I’m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that’s not the view I’m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\\n\\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\\n\\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It’s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\\n\\nFinally, my second view is that it’s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we’ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they’re not, so we don’t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior – but it’s worth it to us, so that we don’t get mugged. \\n\\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there’s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\\n\\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\\n\\n\\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don\\'t think it\\'s always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there\\'s an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn\\'t really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \\n\\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I\\'m not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it\\'s very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won\\'t get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I\\'ve changed my view to the point that I don\\'t think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it\\'s often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they\\'re the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \\n\\nAt any rate, I\\'ve enjoyed reading the responses so far; I\\'m aware this is a sensitive issue, and I\\'m glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues.  \\n            \\nAmerica's innovation and education rankings would be lower. Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around. \\n                        \\n(**Note:**I'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point, what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around. Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them?)         \\n               \\n**Was view changed?**  \\nIts a complicated issue. Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population?  Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive? Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics?          -(choppy writing, but i'm on 3 hours of sleep and stretched for time, give me a break)-   \\n        \\n                 \\n(Side thought: Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children. Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower? This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value. Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. *no that isn't a serious sentiment, i'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point* )    \\n                          \\nThen there is the next question. Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit? Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not.\\n            \\nThen there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one. This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country.  Modern technology like the internet must be considered.\\n                 \\n             \\nYes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite.

Throughout human history, conquerors with superior technology have succeeded over less capable and less innovative cultures. It's ruthless, yes, but the reality is conquered cultures were less capable than the victors. Therefor it is in the best interest of cultures to strive for innovation, invention, progress, technology, and science. Not only does this secure survivability, but also increases standard of living.\\n\\nColonel Quaritch, as well as the other miners, were there to extract resources which benefited this endeavor. They were striving to better their abilities through use of the metal under the tree the Na'vi inhabited. \\n\\nArguably, Colonel Quaritch **COULD** have massacred the residents of Hometree. It was well within his ability and means. Instead, a chance to evacuate is given, and Quaritches forces **target Hometree itself, not the Na'vi** The fleet do not gun down the fleeing residents, nor do they pursue. Their goal was the resources under the tree, and not the extermination of the people.\\n\\n\\nNext, Quaritch ceases hostilities against the Na'vi until Jake assembles a massive force around the headquarters. Quaritch **COULD** have met them in battle, but instead what does he do? Tries to avoid direct bloodshed by taking out a cultural symbol, thus potentially avoiding loss of life among both Na'vi and Human. \\n\\n\\nThe culture of the Na'vi could have ended up like the Native Americans. Conquered, but preserved through merciful reservations granted by the victors. Instead they opted for resistance, and I'm interested to see what the sequel holds for them. In the mean time, I feel Colonel Quaritch's actions were rational, reasonable, justifiable, and the correct course of action.

This is idiotic for a multitude of reasons.\\n\\n**1. It makes the game less fun.**\\n\\nWould you want to play Mario Kart without items? Fuck no. That removes all of the excitement and variation in the game. Same applies to Smash.\\n\\nSure enough, there was a post in r/nintendo or r/wiiu last week asking if there could be a competitive Mario Kart scene and most of the responses were \"not unless they remove items\". But then what\\'s the point? Where\\'s the fun? Just play another goddamn racing game if you want to play Mario Kart without items and just play another goddamn fighting game if you want to play Smash Bros. without items.\\n\\nEDIT: This part of my view has been changed.\\n\\n**2. It\\'s restricting the intended purpose of the game.**\\n\\nWhy would you remove features from the game that are meant to be used? You\\'re taking the game and making it into something it\\'s not. It\\'s like deliberately ordering a supreme pizza and picking off all the ingredients. Fucking pointless and borderline disrespectful to the developers (I\\'ll admit this last part is a bit dubious, but, well...they did work to put it in the game as a main function of the game and it makes up a good portion of their creative output. It\\'s kinda lame to just ignore that aspect of it).\\n\\nEDIT: This part of my view has also been changed.\\n\\n**3. Not only do items not hinder the competitive aspect of the game; they add to it, making their restriction the hindrance.**\\n\\nThis is the big one. This is why competitive Smash players leave items off in the first place: Because \"the random aspect makes the game less competitive\". Um...how? I mean, I guess the justification is that the randomness of item types and placement reduces the focus on the players\\' abilities, but to that I say two things:\\n\\n**3A. No, it doesn\\'t remove focus on players\\' abilities.**\\n\\nDo you not even consider that, y\\'know, the person who gets the item still has to use it *correctly*? And you can still dodge it? And, assuming the item doesn\\'t spawn right next to a player, you still have to make the dash to the item before someone else ***OR*** decide not to go for it at all. This is where the game becomes *more* competitive with the use of items. You have to actually take them into account. I imagine a common argument against items is something like \"oh well you suck if you can only win with items on.\" Have you considered that maybe *you* suck because you can\\'t win without them turned off?\\n\\nI guess what I\\'m saying here is that while items add a slight element of chance, they more than make up for it with a multiple separate aspects of player skill.\\n\\n**3B. Even if there is a random aspect to the game...so what?**\\n\\nIt\\'s not as though it\\'s a coin toss or a lottery where it\\'s based entirely on luck. It\\'s just the kinds of items and where they\\'re placed. The addition of luck is part of the fun *and* part of the challenge.\\n\\nLuck and competition are not mutually exclusive. Even with items turned off. It\\'s not even possible for them to be. There\\'s always going to be the possibility of an otherwise champion player making a stupid, fatal fuckup, or a glitch in the game causing an otherwise unwarranted victory. I understand wanting to reduce that element of chance, but removing items does so to the point that the fun in the competition is lost.\\n\\nAt the very least, there should be separate, mainstream Smash tournaments that keep items on.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The term was used to plot a persons learning over their experience (see example [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alanf777_Lcd_fig02.png)).  The example here shows how a person rapidly gains proficiency (or learning) and eventually levels off.  This could be a representations of how a person learns some thing easy, like tic-tac-toe.  Note here that the curve is quite steep, ie the slope is very large (a large change in y over a small change in y).  [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alanf777_Lcd_fig08.png) is a comparison between a steep (in red) and a shallow (in blue) curve.  The shallow curve means that proficiency (or learning) is gained more slowly over time compared to the steep curve.\\n\\nNow words are often used differently in science and in common parlance, theory is a good example.  In common parlance theory means a guess, whereas in science theory means a body of knowledge including all known facts, hypotheses, and natural laws relevant to a particular field of study or  a proposed explanation of a set of related facts or a given phenomenon.  In general, when the term \"steep learning curve\" is used in common parlance it used to describe something difficult to learn.  Eg \"The video game Dark Souls has a very steep learning curve\".  What this sentence is meant to convey is that the game is hard to learn and master, which is clearly described by a shallow learning curve, not a steep one.\\n\\nIn conclusion saying \"This game is hard, it has a steep learning curve\" is equivalent to saying \"I could care less\" when what one meant was \"I couldn\\'t care less\"', 'op-title': 'CMV: The term \"steep learning curve\" is used incorrectly what people really mean is \"shallow learning curve\"', 'pair_ids': ['p_34', 'p_33', 'p_35'], 'train': 1})}),\n",

However despite its shortcomings, I believe that the real heart of the Mass Effect franchise lies not with the story or the narrative, but with its characters. With only a couple exceptions, the vast majority of Shepard\\'s crew are interesting, fleshed-out characters, each with their own flaws and redeeming qualities. \\n\\nFor example, (SPOILERS ME3) seeing Wrex grow from a mere gun-for-hire in ME1 to the responsible, yet still badass leader of the Genophage-free Krogan in ME3 was one of the most gratifying experiences of my gaming career. Similarly, the leap of faith Shepard takes when trusting Legion on Rannoch, thus ending hundreds of years of conflict and bringing the Quarians and Geth together was immensely satisfying and could easily qualify for /r/frission material. \\n\\nWithout these experiences, yeah, Mass Effect 3 didn\\'t live up to the hype. How could it? It\\'s such a hollow victory watching Wreav royally screw things up, or watching Tali commit suicide. In my opinion, it\\'s a complete waste of the player\\'s time going about it that way. Regardless of paragon or renegade alignment, I believe there is one right way to play Mass Effect: a completionist run where NO ONE dies.   \\n\\nI need help guys. It\\'s getting to the point where I can\\'t even discuss Mass Effect with others without judging someone for letting my favorite characters bite the bullet. Hell, I\\'ve put one of my friends off playing the games because I was backseat-gaming during his playthrough.  I WANT to believe that games should be played however the player wants to play them, but for whatever reason it\\'s different for me when it comes to Mass Effect in particular. Please, CMV!\\n\\nEDIT: Just wanted to say that I don\\'t take issue with making an intentionally flawed Shepard to see what it looks like. It\\'s just I feel that some who were more critical of the game could\\'ve missed out on an important and fulfilling character later on because I a mistake, and that could have potentially negatively color their views and the public perception of the game as a whole. \\n\\nBah, apologies!

The LOTR movies are some of the best adaptations of all time *precisely because* they left a whole lot of the books un-filmed, and a whole lot more on the cutting room floor.

Who an applicant knows is occasionally useful for those jobs which require maintaining relationships with certain people in key positions (e.g. sales), but for the vast majority of jobs, who your friends are is functionally irrelevant.  \\n\\n\\'1.3. Allowing someone to circumvent the standard application process (\"jumping the line\") or to use some important person\\'s recommendation as additional clout for their application (\"came very highly recommended by Bob\") is preferential treatment for irrelevant qualities.  \\n\\n\\'1.3.1. I recognize &amp; appreciate that it is difficult in most employment processes to find individuals who are trustworthy, socially apt, etc. This is a failing of the existing job application paradigm, not an excuse to circumvent it in order to make the process easier.  \\n\\n\\'2. Networking, as a practice, favors individuals who come from already socially favorable situations, moreso than other evaluation criteria.  \\n\\n\\'2.1. Beyond straight nepotism, it is self-evident that individuals who come from families &amp; backgrounds which allow for more interaction with individuals in power will be able to call on more of those individuals for networking purposes.  \\n\\n\\'2.2. Individuals who are extraordinarily qualified for a position but come from a region/social background without those connections enter a networking-friendly employment opportunity at a disadvantage.  \\n\\n\\'2.2.1. I understand that there are other unfair advantages an applicant might have (being tall, white, male, etc.). Allowing networking to influence a hiring decision is not dependent on cultural bias &amp; may be safely exorcised from the hiring process to render it more fair - that is what I am suggesting.  \\n\\n\\'3. Businesses &amp; societies would be better off disallowing networking from influencing their hiring decisions.  \\n\\n\\'3.1. If a hiring process takes networking into account, it is necessarily showing preference to individuals who already come from advantaged background, as per 2. This decreases social/economic mobility, which has been demonstrated to be bad for societies in general.  \\n\\n\\'3.2. If the egalitarian hiring process in-place is so ineffective at determining qualifications/character that it must depend on recommendations from trusted sources to establish merit, the productivity of any positions where such a trusted source does not come forward will suffer.  \\n\\n\\'3.3. \"Fix the process, not the game.\"  \\n\\nI understand \"this is how the world works,\" and many feel at ease participating in networking events without any moral qualms.

From what I can tell, there is very little skill involved in playing the game, it just seems to be a giant crapshoot the whole way through.\\n\\n\"Monopoly\" was made with the intent to explain why localised monopolies are bad for the economy and to explain the Single Tax theory of Henry George.^1 Though it does this job well, I believe it is this intent that causes it to be thoroughly not fun. Once ~50% of the board has been claimed, even if the landholdings of all the players are about equal, it is immediately obvious which player will lose based on who falls in another\\'s territory first and has to pay the incredulous tax. After that, it is just a long fall into bankruptcy as eventually the player has to sell their property to others, decreasing the chance that they can earn revenue while simultaneously increasing the chance that the others can profit from them.\\n\\nWhile this system would work in a **quick** game between 2 to 3 people, monopoly is usually drawn out and played with 4+ players. One after another, a player pays out the net-worth to the other players until there is a long, long drawn-out stand-off between the remaining few. At this point, it comes to down to complete and utter chance. Whomever gets the worst successive dice rolls loses. When that happens, barring any statistically unlikely dice rolls, it is evident who will lose. But the game keeps going and going, because it would be \"unfair\" to keep going despite the likely outcome.\\n\\nIf Monopoly was redesigned to rely less on chance (perhaps a redesign of the board, more mechanics to tip the scales of chance perhaps with better \"Chance\" cards, or even removal of the pieces entirely) and to be quicker (Add penalties for each additional player over 3 so that the success and failures of each decision weigh more heavily, for example) then the game will be much more fun and enjoyable to everyone. As of right now, after the first few passes around the board, it is easier to calculate the theoretical outcome with the help of a computer then to finish the game to its completion.\\n\\nPlease change my view, for the sake of family game night. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n&gt;^1 Orbanes, Philip E.

In particular:\\n\\n- The months are uneven. It\\'s confusing to have irregular fluctuations in the length of months. Only one month having 28 or 29 days? Alternating between =31 and &lt;31 days, only to reverse at August? There\\'s no reason to have a complicated calendar just because some ancient emperors had oversized egos. 365 has few factors, so a perfect division is not practical, but we can at least do better than what we have: months 1-5 have 31 days, and months 6-12 have 30, for example (month 6 would get Leap Day).\\n\\n- Months do not line up with seasons. The equinoxes and solstices that define the seasons. Why have the season start 2/3 of the way through the month when they could just happen on the first or second, making that entire month in one season (or close enough)? It would also keep the months as part of division hierarchy: four seasons to a year, three months to a season. As a consequence of this change, the year also wouldn\\'t start in the middle of winter. New Year\\'s Day can be the first day of spring. *Edit* Based on some of the responses I\\'ve been getting, it seems like a lot of places use the term \\'season\\' more colloquially, with summer just meaning \\'when the days are longer and warmer\\' rather than \\'the space between the summer solstice and the autumnal equinox. To clarify, this latter meaning is the one I\\'ve going by. Harvest, hunting, basketball, and tourist seasons are all regional, but the ones that relate to axial tilt are universal, as far as I can tell.\\n\\n~~- School and financial years are misaligned with calendar years. Why have the 2014-15 school year when one could make the entire year line up with the calendar?~~ This one has been answered; Financial years have no set times, and school years vary too much by region to try to align them with a universal calendar. View changed, in this respect.\\n\\nThese are the three particular objections I have. To change my view, explain why these problems are necessary, or at least why fixing them would cause other problems (apart from the practicality of adopting a new system to begin with).\\n\\nI am well aware that actually getting the world to adopt a new calendar is highly impractical, but such practical concerns are beside my point, so I don\\'t intend to argue about that. I\\'m also not going to bother with appeals to tradition.\\n\\nSo change my view.\\n\\n**Edit**\\nThere\\'s been some confusion regarding my intentions here. I am well aware that the costs of switching calendars would be huge, and not worthwhile for the relatively small benefits of having a more consistent system. However, if I allowed for that consideration when constructing my post, I wouldn\\'t have bothered to post it because my view would have already been changed.\\n\\nThe basic question I\\'m interested in is this: are there good reasons to have any of the inconsistencies that the Gregorian calendar currently has? If we were to make a calendar from scratch, is there any reason to have irregular months rather than regular ones? Is there any reason to have the year start in the middle of winter rather than changing at the same time as a new season? These are the parts of this that I want to hear about, not whether it can be implemented.\\n\\nIf it helps you focus on the matter at hand, here\\'s a rephrase: I have a button that, once pressed, will retroactively switch the current calendar to one with the \"fixes\" I describe above. This change is instant, seamless, and will carry no cost apart from the effort to press the button. Convince me not to press it.\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If he doesn't opt out by then, he loses the right to opt out. (The 10 week thing is because pregnancy is pretty obvious by then but the woman's body hasn't been morphed much it looks like. This can be changed, I just based it off looking at pictures.)\\n\\nThese laws mean that a woman can decide, with plenty of time left over for contemplating abortion, if she wants to keep a baby and raise it as a single mom. If she can't raise it on her own she might want to abort, with no great medical risk compared to the risks of pregnancy.\\n\\nI think it would be immoral to bring a child into the world without being capable of providing for it.

I don\\'t know where to start...\\n\\nI\\'m a 25 year old white guy and straight, I\\'ve been single for about 2 years now and before that I was in a relationship for 4 and a half years. I think this is where I started to get bitter. I fell into depression after I broke up with her for sending messages to other guys suggesting she would met up with them for sex. I stumbled across some messages implying she already had but I have no solid evidence. I was a broken man at that point, I don\\'t know how best to describe it, my inner self was shattered. I think I was like that for about 6-8 months but its hard to remember, all the days just blurred together. She had a new boyfriend in less than a week. I hated the fact that she could just be with someone else so soon more than I hated myself for being so God damn pathetic. I also hated that she told people that I was cheating on her and that I had \"other girls on the go the whole time\". I still had her on Facebook at this point and all the guys commenting where the guys she was sending messages to. \"Aw don\\'t worry about it babe he was a dick anyway. Do you need a hug? ;)\" where among the comments she got, and it goes without saying that this brought my blood to boil.\\n\\nBut it isn\\'t just her that has skewed my view on woman. My mother died when I was 8 and me and my older brother where raised by just my dad. As difficult a child I was he did the best job he could with me. It wasn\\'t until about 2004/5 that he met Helen. She was a early 40 something year old nurse that lived about 50 miles away. She would come down every few weeks to see my dad and spend time with me and my brother. We knew right away that something was wrong with her but being so young we couldn\\'t put our finger on it. After a few more months my dad asked us if it would be OK if she stayed with us all the time and move in, of course we didn\\'t object because we could tell in the sound of his voice that he was lonely. Maybe he should have know better or maybe his heart was so desperate for love that he couldn\\'t see that she was a fussy child that thought the universe revolved around, who knows? So when she moved in with us it was less than 6 months before she \"wanted to get a house that belongs to them\" and we were in a new home. I stayed with them until I was 19 and I moved in with my best friend and my girlfriend and I was glad to be gone. My dad had always been very firm but fair with us, never angry or over the top. As soon as we got in to the new house it all changed. It turns out that she didn\\'t want to pay any of the mortgage that had been taken out in both their names. This lead to them arguing all the time. She (it seemed) just wanted to go to work, come home, relax and go shopping (and housework on the weekends only). I don\\'t think that *Oh God its because she a woman that she is so lazy and won\\'t take responsibility!* because it turns out that she was still living with her mum when she came to live with us and her mother still did everything for her. Make her meals, clean her clothes and didn\\'t take any sort of rent from her. She was a stubborn teenager in an adults body. Now fast forward about 6 years, she cheats on my father and moves back into her mum\\'s house. My dad also fell into another depression and stopped eating this time and starting drinking. It brought me to tears the first time I saw him a month after she left, he looked like a skeleton and he didn\\'t even have the ability to smile. He told me that he got a letter from a solicitor of hers say that she wanted half of what the house they got was worth, about £70,000 I think, even though she never paid a penny in to it. Its been sorted now and she is gone for good but over all this time I was losing more and more respect for woman.\\n\\nThen there is the only friend I have right now being controlled by his girlfriend. He has a son with his last girlfriend (who also cheated and left him in dept, funnily enough) and I have to say that he is the most incredible father you\\'ve ever met in your life. His son (5) loves him to bits and is so well behaved and respectful to him, nothing like I was when I was his age. He sees him 3 times a week and has him every other weekend, he sees his family, goes to parks and zoos and whatnot, he gets along with everyone, he loves life and daddy. The mother on the other hand, while providing him with everything he needs and I\\'m sure she is a brilliant mother to him, has decided to move in with her new boyfriend in a new house about 70 miles away, and there isn\\'t anything my friend can do about it. The mother doesn\\'t seem to care too much, \"He\\'ll make new friends, you can see him through Skype, newboyfriend will be a father figure for him\" and yes, she actually said that. He broke down into tears with this, he loves his son more than anything in the world, and to be told by the mother that you can\\'t see him as much and being powerless to stop it just fuels more of this sexist view I carry. The mother is moving at the start of the new year and she hasn\\'t told her son and won\\'t let my friend do it either, or \"I will just tell him that you knew he was going all along and that you didn\\'t tell him\". I\\'m on the phone to him most nights trying my best to make him feel better however I can, but believe it or not, he only talks about his son moving away half the time. The other half is about how unsupportive his current girlfriend is being.\\n\\nNow, she is only 19 and she probably doesn\\'t know how to support someone going through this. To be honest I don\\'t know how either but I\\'m trying my best. From what he tells me she is just tired of him \"constantly going on about it\" and \"not even trying to cheer up\". She is the same as Helen is some respects, lives with boyfriend who pays most of the bills, always gets driven to and from work which his dad got for her and hates it when he spends a bit of money on something nice for himself. She very much has the *What\\'s mine is mines and whats is yours is mine* attitude with everything they have. Shes spoilt, selfish and is making an already horrid situation worse by having a shitty attitude about it. She did the same on my birthday party a few weeks ago. We were all having a drink and dancing and having a good time when suddenly \"Why are you looking at that girls arse?\" comes from her mouth and the night was downhill from there. We all spent a few hours trying to get her to calm down but she was having none of it, *her* night had been ruined because he saw him \"staring\" at some other girl. Later in the night he punched him in the face but he couldn\\'t do anything about it. He wasn\\'t willing to tell some coppers we walked pasted because we knew she would lie and say it was the other way round and that she was the one who was punched or whatever, leading him into trouble (as Reddit keeps reminding me, happens *all the time*).\\n\\nWow, this is far too long. But all of these experiences combined make me look down on woman in general as just overgrown children. Plus stories on the front page are always woman screwing men over by lying then getting away with it just add fuel to the fire. [Its like a quote from Louis C.K](http://i.imgur.com/PVZ9t.jpg) Maybe I need more female friends, maybe I needed a strong female role model in life, but I need to change this toxic view I have. \\n\\n**TL;DR. I\\'ve had one too many bad experiences involving woman in my life and I hate the fact I can\\'t trust one and find it difficult to respect them.**\\n\\nFor the love of God I\\'m begging you, please help me change my view.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But I seem to be one of the like three total fans of Legend of Korra that did not think the series ended the way it should have.\\n\\nThroughout the entire four seasons, nearly every character underwent such major development. Mako used to be a selfish asshole who only cared for his brother and pro-bending, but at the end of the series he was an independent but caring detective who actively contributed to the safety of not only Republic City citizens, but the entire Earth Kingdom. Bolin was an immature kid but at the end of the series he was a matured public speaker who fought for love and for his country. And Korra, most of all, was a childish, uncultured, self-important bender who didn\\'t know what being the Avatar meant, but at the end of the series, up until as close as three minutes before the end, was an independent, mature woman who had learned so much about what it meant to be the Avatar on a global scale. \\n\\nThe finale, however, wherein she is (canonically, as of tonight) romantically matched with Asami, a seemingly minor female character, completely devalued all character development for her and wrapped up the show in the absolute worst way.\\n\\n*1. To pair Korra, a seemingly strong female character, with anyone at all, would not do her justice.* Avatar Korra is a strong, independent Water Tribe woman who don\\'t need no man (or, uh, girl). She broke up with Mako in the second season because she couldn\\'t be with him and be Avatar at the same time, which is a theme consistent with The Last Airbender; Aang had to let go his earthly tethers to enter the Avatar State. The difference for Aang was that there was a whole three seasons of tension between him and Katara, so it was possible for it to happen naturally whereas there was at most (being very generous) half of a season of very vague and ambiguous \"um hey I like u\" for Korra. Even if Korra and Mako or Bolin had gotten together at the end, I don\\'t think I\\'d have been as happy as if Korra went on being the Avatar as the strong woman she was made out to be.\\n\\n*2. To pair Korra with a relatively minor character who was only significant when it was convenient to the team, regardless of gender, is objectively bad fiction.* I don\\'t hate Asami as a character, and I don\\'t hate them being paired because they\\'re both girls and ew yuck same sex. I hate the situation because Asami Sato didn\\'t exist for half of the first season. When she started existing, it was to foil Korra, which was fine and actually good conflict at the time. Then, when it\\'s discovered her dad Hiroshi Sato was an Equalist and a villain, she joined Team Avatar \"full-time\". She and Mako and Korra have had romantic conflict since season two, but Asami was barely important in season three and slightly more important in season four. I say slightly important and not completely unimportant because she was relevant whenever Team Avatar needed a hiding spot/base of operations, a plot weapon, or transportation. But seriously, Varrick ended up being more important to the plot that Asami, and he wasn\\'t even really Team Avatar for three entire seasons.\\n\\n*3. There is no way this ending wasn\\'t fanservice.* This show is the sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, a mature show that the fans called for a sequel to. The first season ended in a murder-suicide. The second season finale completely changed the world of Avatar forever. The third season ended on a terrifying cliffhanger. The fourth (and final) season finale? Avatar Korra, the most powerful bender on the planet, and Asami Sato, one of the two most intelligent minds on the planet (the other being on honeymoon), *go on vacation in the Spirit World and get romantically involved*. While Republic City, Zaofu, and the Earth Kingdom en masse are in ruins, Mako\\'s (and somewhat Bolin\\'s) plots are left almost completely unresolved, The new Earth King is considering radically changing the structure of the Earth Kingdom, the New Air Nation is left nearly forgotten, and literally *every possible way to end the series logically* was unresolved. What!?This relationship is cop-outy bad writing if it were with anybody, literally anyone on the cast, but being it\\'s the only other female character of any importance makes it that much worse. And it\\'s so out of left field! It feels like a fucking fan fiction! It\\'s almost like the directors didn\\'t even care to build to the reveal. \"Oh and they\\'re lesbians, surprise. THE END.\"\\n\\nWhy wouldn\\'t they just end the series with a Tenzin-Korra mentor-student moment, or a Korra-Father moment, or even a tiny reference to Aang and the Gaang, or anything other than the new, forced relationship between Korra and Asami? Why end the series with a relationship at all?!

Of course, since reversible processes don't actually occur in nature they can only be approximated quasi-statically.

It's physically impossible. Humans are made up of massive particles. You know all this. However, it's plausible that future engineers might be able to design crafts that are fit to carry humans at 99.99% the speed of light. Close enough for all intents and purposes. In fact, we can already [build machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) which do this for single particles.\\n\\nSimilarly, we absolutely cannot decrease the entropy of a closed system. It's ([almost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluctuation_theorem)) physically impossible. But it doesn't seem implausible that future engineers might be able to build machines that are efficient enough to approximate processes with zero net entropy increase.

So here goes: Having bought a game on one platform, it\\'s not immoral to pirate the same game on another platform. I\\'m not even really talking legally (though feel free to inform me), but wether I am negatively influencencing the \"victim\" company(s) with this.\\n\\nThis of course excludes remakes, GOTY editions and other versions that add (substantially) to the game, assuming you own the vanilla version. This does not include \"better graphics on PC\" or \"Keyboard/mouse support\".By buying the game on one platform I have compensated the developer fully for all the work gone into making it, buying another version that adds nothing to the previously bought version is just paying twice the price for one product, solely because the rivalery of companies (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo) prevents cross-buy.   \\n\\nExpanding on my personal buying behaviour, 90% percent of the time I wouldn\\'t have re-bought the game anyway, and am doing it purely for convenience (bought on Xbox, torrenting on laptop so I can play it when I\\'m gone too) so the developer/console-company won\\'t make a loss on my illigal copy, and the other 10% of the time I might be interested in rebuying a game bought on console for PC for, say, the mods (which are fully made by people outside the company, and do so for no profit), and I still might just have enjoyed the game enough to justify a rebuy if the price is right (i.e. I enjoyed the first Fable game greatly on Xbox, and  bought Fable: TLC in a Steam sale for $3 so I could play it again with mouse + keyboard and in widescreen. This port technically has some added content but is also the only version available on PC, I wasn\\'t interested in the extra content and could have done without would I have had the option. Therefore, I wouldn\\'t have felt guilty about torrenting it but at that price I have no issue considering the fun and time I put into it already.) \\n\\nYou could argue that in theory, I could buy a console that a company has been selling at a loss in hopes of earning this back in sold games, and pirate every single game on it as I already own them on another gaming machine, therfore have the console company make a loss on me. I think that\\'s  a risk you take when you\\'re selling your machine at a loss, and if that business model doesn\\'t work for you, change it. Of course the odds of someone doing specifically this are very, very low, and is but a minor dent in the ten/hundred thousands or even millions of consumers raking in the profits for these companies. I would be no more harm to them than a person buying the sole console only to let it eat dust in the basement, not to mention the fact that I have a perfectly fine gaming laptop and wouldn\\'t be buying their consoles anyway if it wasn\\'t for their exclusives, which as the name suggests, are exclusive to that console. Along with that, pirating a game on pc fully cuts out the \"machine-developer\" middle man and makes the \"loss\" go directly to the game developer.\\n\\nI think that\\'s pretty much it, I thought this up on the spot and read it over a few times but there might be some holes in it, feel free to use those of course. Also, I do apologise if this has been asked before, I did a quick search before posting and found nothing.

These traits should inspire adult humans to want to guide them, help them, and influence their generation to be a better than ours. Instead many people seem to want to shun them. This has scary implications for our future. If we treat our youth as an annoyance, as not worthy of attention, we will overcorrect what happened to our generation (every kid being coddled and told they are a special butterfly, producing a generation of self-absorbed brats). I get that helicopter parenting has produced bad results in many but shunning children, disliking them, or even hating them is an extreme that will not correct the problem, but rather create an entirely new one. \\n\\n1. I think this attitude mostly comes from two places: One, many redditors are products of helicopter parenting and feel that the world should be about them and they shouldn\\'t have to tolerate \"annoying little ankle-biters.\" And two, it has become cool to be a loner, to be against increasing the surplus population, to be anti-breeder. \\n2. I think, regardless of its origins, this popular negative opinion of children is unhealthy and will damage this generation\\'s youth and thus our future if left unchecked. A child growing up thinking he is less important than everyone else could be just as, if not more, damaging than a child growing up thinking he is more important than everyone else.\\n3. Encouraging these comments and indulging in the circle-jerk perpetuates this attitude and creates a culture of child-haters. As seen by any other popular opinion on reddit.

One of the reasons I like it, however, is because of how serious it does NOT take itself. When people talk about rappers being deep, I laugh most of the time. Especially if they cite Tupac. There are plenty of examples given from rappers who are very conscious and clever, but even those hardly ever say anything I feel holds a candle to good lyrics from other genres. Comparing it to actual poetry I feel is a very immature argument, and usually made by people who never read actual poetry. Also, as someone who has played different musical instruments and rapped, rapping at an elementary level was always much easier than playing an instrument. Singing takes years to learn well enough to do in public, but most people can jot down some typical rap lyrics with ease, and learn to recite them over a beat pretty easy. \\n\\nCase in point, Eazy E became a famous rapper (even touring the white house) doing something he was terrible at. And rightfully so, because you can be a terrible rapper and still sell a ton of records and actually be considered great at what you do, and that does not apply to other forms of music. \\n\\n***EDIT*** Thanks a ton for your replies, an downvotes.

There are serious parallels between the Great Gatsby, and Hip-Hop culture. Both portray their main characters as being born from poverty, and progressing to riches only through disregard of their morals, chasing money. Illmatic, a hiphop classic, is full of references to this part of hiphop culture. \"Is like a maze full of black rats trapped\" says Nas, in the famous NY state of mind. The next track, \"Life\\'s a bitch\" goes further into this mentality -\"Visualising the realism of life in actuality fuck who\\'s the baddest a persons status depends on salary\". Another classic hiphop song C.R.E.A.M. resigns to this fact as Gatsby does - \"Cash rules everything around me.\"\\n\\nThe racism aspect is also clear - \"Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon, and at the airport they check all through my bags and tell me it\\'s random **but we stay winning** \" This is also where the stereotypical hate for the police comes from. Nas, in a song about the crushing poverty where he grew up - Memory Lane - says \"No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace\". Even worse than the fellow black people trying to get out - like Gatsby, are the police, trying to keep the \" Black rats\" in the trap. \"Judges hanging niggas, incorrect bails, for direct sales, my intellect prevails, from a hanging cross, with nails.\"\\n\\nThe mentality of being born into a racist system, trying to keep you down, combined with the constant drumming into you what the American dream is, motivates people to do terrible things. But I think that Hiphop deserves more attention, and credit, for being a modern day retelling of the flawed American Dream, and Racist System, and what happens when they meet.\\n\\n\"He see it as another felony drug arrest, any day could be the day he picks the wrong thug to test, slug through the vest, shot in the street **for pulling heat on a father whose baby gotta eat**\"', 'op-title': 'CMV: Hiphop culture was born at the cross roads of racism, poverty, and the American Dream, and deserves more credit', 'pair_ids': ['p_108'], 'train': 1})}),\n",

It highlights a range of content that is racist, sexist, or generally offensive that is regularly upvoted and validated by significant portions of the reddit community. Things that can and do reach the front page(or are tangentially connected to it through things like the comments of such threads).\\n\\nNow, the largest complaint I see is that the community is a \"hate group\", which seems a bit silly to me. Who are they discriminating against? White Males? As far as I know, that\\'s what the majority of the community is composed of.\\n\\nSecondly, often times the content they highlight are offensive jokes, and these statements are defended with statements like \"its just a joke.\" This makes the accusation that SRS is a hate group to me even stranger, given that the vast majority of the comments in the comment section tend to be similar jokes, just at the expense of those who mocked the disadvantaged(or and assumed image of them). Can those who like making jokes at the expense of others not take what they dish out?\\n\\nThirdly, and probably most importantly, SRS is, in my view, a very necessary force of balance. People like to say they are a force of censorship, but I don\\'t agree with that. First and foremost, for all the complaints about brigading, very few of the content they highlight is downvoted into obscurity. Beyond that, Freedom of Speech is only guaranteed by the US Government, but not by private companies like Reddit, or massive populations like Reddit\\'s user base. Being downvoted isn\\'t censorship. You expressed your sentiment, and the community rejected it. Nothing was denied beyond validation. Reddit is an immensely useful medium and interface for connecting to people all over the world, and it receives new users every day. When memes like Opinion Puffin basically degenerate into a way for people to seek validation for racist and sexist beliefs, and this stuff gets upvoted to the front page from being on one of the sites most populated subs, it can give the wrong idea as to what kind of community actually uses this site, or give someone a good reason for not joining, which is sad, because social connection is exactly what Reddit was obviously designed to foster.\\n\\nAnyway, those are my main reasons for my current position. Other stuff may come up in the discussion, but this should be enough to at least get the ball rolling. For the sake of acknowledging the other side of this debate, I do understand they have a history of doxxing that is controversial, but my knowledge of those instances are pretty hazy, so someone more familiar with what happened there can maybe shed some light on it that could change my view.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There must be proportionality between the infringement and the objective.\\n\\nIn contrast, in the US, a restriction on free speech like in the *Whatcott* case above would be subject to [strict scrutiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny)  To meet the strict scrutiny standard the restriction must:\\n\\n1. Be justified by a compelling government interest.  The reason for the restriction has to be something the government *has* to do, not merely something they want to do.\\n\\n2. Be narrowly tailored to that interest.  That is, the restriction must be very specific to the exact thing the government must do.\\n\\n3. Be the least restrictive means possible to achieve the compelling government interest.  That means if there is any other way to accomplish the goal, it must be done before abridging the constitutional right in question.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court of the US took on a case of much more hateful anti-gay speech than the *Whatcott* case right around the same time.  [That opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-751.pdf) sums up the US attitude to speech pretty well:\\n\\n&gt;Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and—as it did here—inflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker. As a Nation we have chosen a different course—to protect even hurtful\\nspeech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate. \\n\\nAll my Canadian friends think this I\\'m crazy for agreeing with this and wanting to allow people like the Westboro church (who were the people in that case) to speak freely.\\n\\nChange my view.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The truth is that most people, when thinking of what is right and wrong, do *not* decide on ethical principles and then reason outwards from those principles.

These people came to egalitarian conclusions at least one hundred years *before* feminism and the animal liberation movement.\\n\\nThere exists a continuum of moral agency, with those moral visionaries being a small portion of the population, the average person as the majority (obviously) and another minority of people constitutionally incapable of moral agency (the severely mentally disabled, infants, perhaps psychopaths).\\n\\nSo, what would a good person look like?\\n\\n1.

Very few people are good in any meaningful sense.  Most are merely good enough, in that they acquiesce to and maintain the social order engineered by moral visionaries.

Most of it to me, comes off as basic cop hating, and doesn\\'t actually provide a reasonable solution that improves the amount of corrective justice taking place. In fact, it impedes the justice system because it introduces external hoops for police to jump over doing their job. My arguments are as follows:\\n\\nIncreasing police accountability increases police liability. In the era of social media, one bad experience can cost you your whole career. This is true for every job, BUT it\\'s exceptionally true for police who on a day to day basis subject themselves to this form of public scrutiny. I don\\'t see this going away under the current status quo, but I do think that adding more barriers to this particular issue destroys something the general populous values. Job stability. \\n\\n1.) Becoming a police officer like any other form of training is an investment, and the current state of affairs and the proposed state of affairs will diminish job stability for police officers. This results in a net negative in effective justice, because less officers means more crime. \\n\\n2.) It will create an upward trend in the risk/reward mentality. Due to their scarcity, cops will eventually lead to higher compensations to incentivize the fields. This is something present in other fields already where scarcity for the position exists, such as medical nurses having large signing bonuses. This leads to increased police spending for less officers, once again creating a net negative for justice.\\n\\n\\n3.) The proposed things I\\'ve heard (such as maiming instead of killing and body cams) provide proper closure for a negligible amount of cases, but create far more gaps in coverage than they are worth. So it\\'s logically inconsistent to say:\\n\\n \"Make cops more accountable, so we can have more true justice.\" \\n\\nRaising the liability of police officers, and destroying police coverage because of this ideology is not a positive boon to the justice system. Yes more high profile cases are covered better, but their frequency is too infrequent to justify the loss of police force. At which point if you insist on some of the measures suggested you are not for more justice, you are just cop hating.\\n\\nPlease CMV.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It is a phrase all of us have used or heard, most likely within the past few days. It is a phrase built to end arguments, prevent yelling, and provide a middle ground for those who simply can not agree. There are many cases that the phrase can be used for its intended purpose and remain harmless. One such case an argument is based SOLELY on opinion, such as preference to chocolate or vanilla, hot or cold, red or blue. Another case is when an argument has continued through all other types of context and discourse that it has simply boiled down to a difference of opinion, often dealing with some sort of sensory information(feel taste smell etc.). Unfortunately, the use of \"everyone is entitled to their opinion\" has shifted over time, and is more often than not used in a visceral and spiteful manner. That is when the phrase becomes dangerous. The thought process behind the spiteful and lazy use of that phrase is what allowed cultures (speaking mostly of the US because that is where I am from) to slide away from a collective and productive entity, and into a state of cyclical banter.  My evidence of the danger of the phrase and the effect it has had on the culture is as follows:  \\n\\n1. People use the phrase to lazily get out of arguments that are difficult, or are in a field that they are not familiar with. They use the phrase to cover up their ignorance, in order to protect their misconstrued beliefs. They will argue in circles for hours about something they don\\'t know, and justify the entire waste of brainpower as an \"opinion difference\" in order to move on with their lives without fracturing their beliefs.  \\n\\n2. The idea of being an \"expert\" on a topic is no longer valid. It is no longer valid because bits and pieces of info are so readily available, individuals will allow themselves to feel they have enough information to form a strong belief without being an expert on the topic. The invaluable amount of time true experts spend in their fields(10,000 hours according to the fantastic book \"Outliers\" by Malcolm Gladwell) is nullified by the amount of perceived expertise that is part of our current cultural climate.  \\n\\n3. Factual arguments that can be argued down to a relative \"truth\" within the context of the argument are no longer explored. Opinions are seen as facts that are carelessly spewed from various news(propaganda) organizations. The \"Everyone is entitled to their opinion\" mindset is the engine that drives the divide in cultural beliefs. No suitable and rational arguments are being made anymore because an OPINION is something that doesn\\'t need to be changed as everyone is entitled to have one. \\n\\nThere are many more examples that I will go into if needed.  \\n\\nEssentially what I am saying is that the idea behind the phrase, and the misuse of the phrase is an underlying cause of many of the political, cultural, and social issues that continue to exist year after year(with many of them getting worse). The idea that everyone has an entitlement when it comes to opinions that affect beliefs is preposterous and dangerous.  \\n\\nAs a personal conclusion, many of the points I made in the write-up, and many of the points I will make in the comments are in fact hypocritical. I am not innocent in the claims that I am making, so please help me not be as cynical and free me from my hypocrisy.  \\n\\nCMV!\\n\\nPS: If any of my points are not clear enough, or are not expanded enough feel free to ask and I will try to better explain them.  \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

So I am a firm believer in cultural relativism, that you can not judge a culture base off of morals or societal norms you gained from your own culture. So we have example one, that being gay is okay because we have seen it throughout history in many different cultures, the Greeks being a prime example. However they also were constant offenders of pedophilia, forcing twelve year old boys to give oral sex to grown men. We bring up pacific island cultures, that idolize drag queens and transgenders, however there are also cultures where the women teach the 9 year old boys how to have sex. How can the first be okay but not the second. They are both acceptable in their respective cultures just one is deemed disgusting in our culture. We bring up animals, point out how so many different species have gay relationships, but animals also start having sex as soon as they are able to produce babies, which is like twelve for us. Being gay is natural, being a pedophile is natural, we see both through out history and across species lines. Neither are the \"norm\" but are widely accepted in many cultures. However, westernized cultures have deemed sex with children to be wrong. I ask a westerner what they think about pedophilia they say its disgusting. Its the same when I ask a homophobic Christians what they think about gay people, they say it\\'s disgusting. Both are view points that have been instilled in those people through their culture. Since it is widely accepted that pedophilia is bad, I feel like the gay community gets defensive and tries to distant themselves for pedophilia, when in truth they are very much alike. \\n\\nBefore I get all the messages of being homophobic or being a child molester, I figured I\\'d state my views. I am in full support of the gay community, I have a gay sister that I love very dearly. I am in noway condoning or promoting pedophilia I too find it disgusting and wrong but understand that that viewpoint is a product of the society I grew up in.  \\n\\nEdit: view has been changed, giving credit to /u/terribleusername. He argued with the idea of cultural relativism in mind. Not blindly calling pedophilia rape because kids cannot give consent. As I argued with many of you the consent line we draw is arbitrary. Others seemed to just be arguing on the premise that being a pedophile is bad, when my view was that it is related to being gay regardless of right and wrong. Everything seemed to opinion based. Like it causes harm, which I understand is by our standards wrong, but is still an opinion. Whats the correct age of consent, all still opinion and too loosely defined for my liking, to actually change my view. However /u/terribleusername pointed out that the difference would be that every culture has a cultural line for it. The fact that every culture must make a different line for the age of consent makes it a bit different from homosexuality. I know I argued consent with a lot of people, but the point is that we or even culture have to question consent, it makes it a little different from being gay.

I tried to explain my position as clearly as I could, and in cases like that, my writing tends to take a decidedly formal swerve. I\\'m aware that this carefully formal style may make me sound smug, pompous, or whatever other adjectives of oblivious self-inflation may apply. If anything I write strikes you that way, I\\'m sorry. I only ask you to keep in mind that it probably stems from love of precision and perhaps poor judgment of tone, rather than from condescension.)\\n___\\n\\n##Background\\n\\nThis topic is on my mind because it\\'s apparently been raised again recently in an episode of Aaron Sorkin\\'s *The Newsroom*, and I just read in today\\'s New York Times an [article about the controversy that episode aroused](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/arts/television/hbos-the-newsroom-draws-backlash-over-rape-plot.html). It seems the episode involved a credible, empathetic accuser and a \"sketchy\", offscreen accused, so that the viewer automatically tends to give her story credence. Even so, a journalist in the episode argues that it is unethical to publically accuse the man in front of a television audience, without any conviction or trial.\\n\\nThis seems to have aroused a huge backlash, with articles published [on Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/a-terrible-episode-with-worse-timing-the-newsroom-tack-1668181204) and elsewhere accusing Aaron Sorkin of choosing to \"victim-blame a woman who was raped\"—despite the fact, that, as Sorkin points out in a later quotation in the article, he *created* this character to be a sympathetic *alleged* rape victim whose story has been neither corroborated nor disproved.\\n\\nAnother quotation from the NYT article:\\n\\n&gt;Emily Nussbaum, the TV critic for The New Yorker, wrote of the producer character: “**He argues that the idealistic thing to do is not to believe her story.**”\\n\\n___\\n##Presentation of my views\\n\\nIt seems to me that in discussions of this sort, people persistently conflate \"not believing one\\'s story\" with \"disbelieving one\\'s story\", as if there were no option other than believing in one thing or the opposite—but this distorts the basic fact that in a world where perfect truth is unattainable, NOT believing in something is distinct from DISbelieving it. When two people dispute something, and I don\\'t have a good reason to believe one or the other, my default position is not to presumptively believe either until the introduction of further evidence. This is a commonplace in most areas of human life, but when the subject in dispute is whether A raped B it seems less and less to be taken for granted.\\n\\nMoreover, I believe that it is extremely difficult to come up with credible statistics about how likely uncorroborated accusations are to be true for the simple reason that one is inherently dealing with disputed, uncorroborated things, and is very liable to fall into circular reasoning or a similar lapse in rendering the all important question of how to categorize a given accusation for purposes of his study. For this reason, I mentally have grave reservations every time I read a number purporting to say what percentage of rape accusations are true or false.\\n\\nFurthermore, even if, for argument\\'s sake, one granted that the vast majority of rape accusations were true, I still believe that due process as we think of it with regard to criminal accusations of any sort—*viz.*, \"innocent until proven guilty\"—would remain vitally important, because its abrogation in *any* case would warp the incentive structures embedded in our society. It would be a very dangerous thing to create a system that provides an avenue for a false accuser to disastrously affect someone else\\'s life, while facing little or no potential negative impact him- or herself.\\n___\\n##Summary of my views\\n\\nThe views I\\'m asking you to change, if you can, are:\\n\\n1. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to know with any accuracy what percentage of rape accusations are true or false. Therefore, assumptions of this nature should be given very limited credibility in the broader discussion of how to deal with a rape accusation.\\n\\n2. The protocol of \"innocent until proven guilty\" is important NOT as a method of determining actual truth (how could it be?) but as a way to avoid creating societal systems that can be manipulated and abused by false accusers. As such, it should be adhered to whenever departing from it would create a loophole for such abuse.\\n\\n3. A common and misleading rhetorical tactic frequently used by advocates of strengthening laws and other societal devices intended to discourage and/or punish rape is to frame the issue as if the only two possibilities are for us to presumptively believe one side or the other. This ignores the third, most important possibility of all, which is not to take a presumptive position in the absence of corroborating evidence. The false assumption that one must begin by taking a presumptive position distorts the practical issues at hand to the point of making reasonable discussion on them impossible while that assumption remains unchallenged.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n##My biases\\n\\nI should mention for the record that I have a tendency to think about things in the abstract rather than relating to them strongly on an emotional level (an INTP personality type, if you like [the Myers-Briggs categorization system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator)). Furthermore, I\\'m a man and do not personally know any rape victims that I\\'m aware of, so to the extent that I do relate to these things on an emotional level (which of course I do, too) I feel more strongly the plight of the hypothetical innocent man facing a false accusation (the position I can more readily imagine myself in) than the hypothetical violated woman seeking justice.\\n\\nI\\'m aware of both these biases, and of course, like everything else in our world of matter and men, my views are also subject to Newton\\'s First Law, which states that to alter them requires a force equivalent to that with which they were previously held.\\n\\n___\\n\\n##And so...\\nwith those caveats in mind, change my views please, if you will: any or all of them. Even if you don\\'t succeed in changing them entirely, I\\'ll welcome any added perspective you can provide me, and I believe I\\'m open to that much at the very least.\\n\\n____\\n\\n##PS: Support roles\\n\\nA number of people in this thread have drawn a distinction between the roles of (ideally) neutral public figures like law officers and journalists and the roles of a person\\'s support system (immediate family and close friends), suggesting that public stances in cases like this should be neutral, but private stances should be unreservedly supportive. I\\'d tentatively agree with that, with the proviso that I\\'d apply it equally to close friends of either potential victim (of rape or of slander). I\\'d add that I feel people should be generally freer to rely on their individual judgment in deciding what to believe when they\\'re not acting on those beliefs in a way that\\'s liable to directly cause harm to someone else.\\n\\n____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I do believe that the majority of people are, in fact, corrupt. So assuming you take a random person and insert them into a position of power, it is likely that they will abuse the power that is granted to them. But, I also believe if you take a person who isn\\'t corrupt, and insert them into this same position of power, they will not abuse the privileges and power of the position that is granted to them.\\n\\nI think teachers illustrate this point very well, especially because it is much easier to become a teacher than say, the President of the United States. In this regard, you tend to have a larger sample size and have many more types of people to consider. In most cases, I would say that teachers tend to have absolute power over their classes, at least with regards to day-to-day activities. (Generally, if a teacher says to do something, it is expected that the student comply to the demand of the teacher. If the student disagrees, typically the matter is resolved at a later date with the intervention of a teacher\\'s superior.)\\n\\nTaking this assumption that teachers have absolute power over their students, you still tend to find a balance of teachers who abuse their power, and those who don\\'t. If the saying that \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\" were true, all teachers would abuse their power, since it is the power that corrupts the person, and not the person that corrupts the power.\\n\\nParents work well for this example as well. Literally anybody can become a parent, as having a child is as easy as having sex. I would even say that parents definitely have absolute power over their children, even moreso than teachers. But even with parenting, you still tend to find a balance. Some parents are incredibly strict and unfair, dictating arbitrary rules for their children that they themselves may not follow, or rules that have no legitimate reason other than \"because I say so.\" (I\\'m not arguing the fact that sometimes parents use the \"because I say so\" justification even if the rule does have a legitimate reason, but sometimes parents don\\'t actually have a reason other than \"I say so.\") However, you also find parents that are incredibly fair with their children. If a child does not agree with a rule set by a parent, and argues his or her case fairly, there are parents that would reconsider and change their rule for the sake of being fair. If \"absolute power corrupts absolutely,\" parents like the latter would not exist, as the power they hold over their child would corrupt them.\\n\\nTL;DR: CMV: Absolute power does not corrupt absolutely; absolute corruption corrupts power absolutely.', 'op-title': \"CMV: Power doesn't corrupt people.\", 'pair_ids': ['p_161'], 'train': 1})}),\n",

We elected representatives... People who are supposed to stand for the general public, not a couple corporations. Additionally - we all know Obama is pro neutrality.

You\\'re willing to limit one of the greatest inventions for technological growth in the last century just because the other party doesn\\'t want to limit it? You have no basis to your argument, its just that Obama is for it. And apparently he is never morally right ?

I do not necessarily think there is a *responsibility* for C to do so, though. However, this is not central to my belief, or to this post.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Tell them that if they don\\'t like how they look, then they have the power to change it and that you believe that they can. \\n\\nEDIT:I\\'ve softened my stance due to a post that showed there there are situations where this could be appropriate.

The narrative for almost all mainstream coverage of these women  universally supports them, and an inordinate portion of these articles focuses on harassment from a small group of psychopaths and trolls, which usually includes quotes of some of the most tasteless comments for shock value. Because of this, I believe that the threats and trolling these women have experienced has greatly helped their cause. People unfamiliar with the games industry who read these articles are led to believe that a large portion of those opposing these women are psychopath basement dwellers making rape threats. Because this narrative helps their movement so much, I believe that feminists who support the actions of these women can definitely help their movement by creating many fake, anonymous accounts and viciously threatening feminist public figures with them. Drawing from this, while hardcore members of Gamergate have undoubtedly trolled and threatened these women, I believe a decent portion of the vitriol against these women is posted by their supporters.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I don't think there's anything wrong with asexuality or bisexuality or any form of -sexuality that doesn't hurt someone. I am biromantic and I can sort of understand being heteroromantic or homoromantic. But I have not heard a description of aromantic that does not make me feel like those people need help. \\n\\nFrom my perspective, romantic attraction is just a natural extension of normal love, like the love you have for your friends or family. To fall in love means to trust and care about someone else even more than you do about your friends, enough to want to spend your life with them and dedicate a significant amount of your time and resources to their happiness and your mutual happiness. I think love is very important to being mentally and emotionally healthy. I don't think you can be emotionally healthy if you don't have any friends, if you shun people and never express love. So when people say that they are physically incapable of loving and trusting someone enough to enter a romantic relationship, I feel like something has to have gone wrong. \\n\\nSexuality is one thing. Sexuality is about physical response and physical acts, it is who turns you on and who you want to have sex with. Bodies are weird things, physical reactions can range into bizarre in most situations (I mean, consider allergies) and the actions people take are their own business (again, so long as nobody's getting hurt). But romantic feelings are based in emotion and thought and when something is very different with emotion and thought, when you are *lacking something* that most people have that has to do with emotion and thought, we call it a mental disorder. People who are lacking the ability to properly control their motivation and attention have ADHD. People who are lacking the ability to feel alright most of the time have Depression or Bipolar disorder. People who are lacking the ability to distinguish reality are schizophrenic or have delusions. So why are people who are lacking the ability to form romantic relationships...considered fine? \\n\\nWhy is there a disconnect between the view of someone who can't make friends (such as those with [Schizoid Personality Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder), which we do consider problematic) and people who can make friends but can never take it any further than that (people with Aromanticism, which we don't consider problematic)?\\n\\nI guess the crux of my argument is that I believe there are different kinds of love of varying strengths. Love for your mom, for your grandma, for your aunt, for your best friend, for inanimate things. And I think romantic love is kind of the epitome of it, something to strive for. It's one thing to not be in love or not be looking for love, but to say you're actually just totally incapable of it? I call that mental illness.\\n\\nChange my view?\\n\\n**EDIT: Thank you, /u/nikoberg. View changed.**\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This topic isn\\'t about moderates who only support gun use for hobbies and recreation.\\n\\n**tl;dr, or the way I should\\'ve phrased the thread initially: CMV: Abortion is a form of self-defense. Those who believe you have the right to use deadly force in self-defense should also support abortion in at least some cases, if not all.** \\n\\nThe main justification for being pro-gun is that people need guns to defend themselves. Unique to arguing that people should carry guns as opposed to pepper spray or other self-defense tools is that guns are used to kill, not incapacitate. By being pro-gun, you are pro-giving people the right to choose to kill another person. A circumstance in which you would be allowed to do so under the castle doctrine, stand your ground laws, etc. would be that the other person is threatening your property or body. Pro-gun activists can\\'t really argue that you have to know your attacker intends to kill you, as by the time you know they mean to kill you (as opposed to rob you, assault you, etc.) it\\'s likely too late for your gun to be effective. Ultimately, the pro-gun argument relies on one ordinary person being given the power to decide to end someone else\\'s life, without the need for lengthy deliberation that state-administered capital punishment requires.\\n\\nNext, the main justification for being pro-life is that fetuses have \"personhood\" and deserve the same rights as people. If you\\'re pro-gun, however, you\\'re arguing that someone has the right to kill another person if that person is intruding on their property or threatening their body. This definitively rules out cases where the mother\\'s health is at risk and the mother would choose to preserve her own life first, as in [the infamous recent case of a woman dying in Ireland of medical complications after being denied an abortion.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar) However, it can be more broadly applied to other, less critical abortions. For the same reason you would be justified in shooting to kill someone who is assaulting you or entering your home, you should be justified in killing someone who is literally occupying your body for months. At the very least, abortion must be legalized in cases of rape, as you never consented to even the possibility of having a person invade your body/property. \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t mean pro-gun people are in any way obligated to personally prefer abortion for themselves (just as they may not choose to shoot an intruder within their home), but they should support legal abortion on the basis that others should be given that choice. \\n\\nA counterargument I can foresee is that to someone who is pro-gun, an attacker forfeits their right to life by being a criminal, and fetuses are innocent. However, this argument doesn\\'t really fly. Firstly, there\\'s no way of knowing why an intruder has entered your home - maybe they were forced to by someone else or coerced into it. Secondly, even if a fetus has technically not consciously committed a crime, it is still by its very existence invading another person\\'s body/property if that person did not consent to it being there. If you invite a person/fetus into your home/body you don\\'t have the right to kill them, but in order to remain logically consistent you should be able to remove them with deadly force in both cases.\\n\\nFinally, there\\'s no corollary here - because pro-choice arguments don\\'t rely on personhood, there\\'s no hypocrisy in being pro-gun rights or pro-gun control because it\\'s a completely separate issue.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I\\'m sure this topic has come up in this subreddit before but I still haven\\'t been convinced to change my view. I concede that one should not eat pets that have already been \"claimed\" (i.e. don\\'t take your neighbor\\'s cat and put it in your soup). However, why shouldn\\'t one be able to go to the local dog pound to pick up some meat for dinner? Animals in shelters/pounds are not \"claimed\" by anyone and will eventually be euthanized.

Why is it so appalling to consume cats/dogs when we have no problems with eating pigs and sheep? I\\'ve encountered the argument that cats/dogs have \"evolved\" with the human race, but to be honest, all animals that are currently alive are equally \"evolved\". Of course, historically, cat/dogs have had their uses beyond just being food but this idea doesn\\'t seem to apply to horses (which were used as transportation), sheep (which provide wool), pigs (provide leather), and cows (provide leather).\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for all the input!

I\\'ve posted this somewhere in the thread but decided to post it somewhere more visible: \"I\\'ve come to the conclusion that pet consumption should be discouraged based on potential health problems (*definitely not because we should feel bad about it or because some animals are \"more intelligent\" than others*). Additionally, large scale maintenance of dog/cat farms (and subsequently large scale consumption) would be economically inefficient. However, the government should not ban pet consumption because dogs/cats eaten in small amounts is not detrimental to health or economy.\"\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

So we should refer to the 1st century AD as \"the ought century\" AD, and then continue with 100s AD, 200s AD, and same for BC.\\n\\nThat was just a suggestion.

My sister was speaking about leaving her money to her kids after her passing, and I casually mentioned how I don\\'t believe I\\'d leave any. This was met with much more vitriol from both my mom and sister than I expected. Since my sister only seems to argue by using mindless platitudes (she just kept saying \"you take care of your own\" over and over) and my mother just kept telling me \"that is wrong\" without explaining why, I\\'d like to have a discussion on it here to see if I really am mislead in my views. Consider the following scenario:\\n\\nI have amassed a large fortune and have grown to be about 80. I had my kids in my 30s, and so they are now in their 40s. My assumption would be that during the first 20 or so years, I have taken care of their educational costs, provided for their basic needs, and hopefully shown them the value of a dollar while still allowing them a life not bound by severe monetary constraints. After their 20s, when they have begun providing for themselves, I will be there as a back-up should something truly catastrophic and unforeseen happen, but they would be largely left to their own devices. After 20 or so years of that, when I die, I would plan on leaving all my wealth to charities of my choice. I don\\'t even think I\\'d leave anything for the grandkids\\' education as I believe that falls under the responsibility of the parents or even the children to properly finance and plan.\\n\\nThe reasoning:\\n\\nStatistics: 60% of the second-generation blow all the inheritance money during their lifetime. That statistic climbs to 90% when you move into the third-generation. To me, this indicates that leaving a large inheritance to children who did not work for the money leads them to invest it poorly and blow it on frivolous spending (I\\'m not saying this happens in all cases, as I know medical bills and a billion other situations could arise that would necessitate the costs, but I\\'m saying it is the most common reason).\\n\\nEthics: I don\\'t believe that people should benefit simply by being born into a beneficial situation. Being born to wealthy parents shouldn\\'t be like winning the lottery for your entire life. As I mentioned, these kids would not feel the claws of poverty during their entire childhood; why should they be guaranteed these \"lottery winnings\" well into adult life, when they are supposed to be responsible for themselves? Moreover, leaving this wealth to the children will actually negatively affect their lives, as it will foster laziness and lack of ambition. Nearly every tycoon, from Carnegie to Buffett to Gates has noted that leaving anything more than a small sum of money to their children would be terrible for their ambition and their motivation to make something of their lives.\\n\\nSome final comments: I understand that this is putting the cart WAY before the horse. I don\\'t have considerable wealth. I don\\'t even have kids. This is just how I believe I\\'d behave in this scenario given my current mindset. Furthermore, I really don\\'t want to come off as miserly, but if I do, please tell me. Anyway, beyond that, please try and change my view!\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I advocate conceal carrying and think the law abiding citizen should own whatever they want. However, when it comes to debate, I struggle finding a reason people *need* an AR15. \\n\\n**Argument**\\n\\nThe standard, but weak, argument I currently give in favor of an AR15 is, *everybody is different and needs to find the gun that\\'s right for them; different sized hands, arm length, number of arms (less than two), and ability shoot accurately all play a role in weapon selection, and there is no one gun that fits everyone. So if some shoot better with an AR15, that’s the gun they should own.*\\n\\nThat\\'s my standard argument, but there\\'s a part of me that still nags the question, \"if anyone can train to use any weapon, why is the AR15 needed?\"\\n\\n**AR15**\\n\\nMy exposure to the AR15 community extends beyond just what I hear about on TV. I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them. Here\\'s what I think of them, personally.\\n\\nWhat I think of the AR15 is, it\\'s a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun. The accessories go with a theme or purpose of what role the AR15 is suppose to fill. If I go to the range and show any interest in someone\\'s AR, they\\'ll ask me if I want to try it, then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it. What the AR guys do is, they buy their AR then dump money into parts, which they add throughout the year. It\\'s like Lego\\'s, except each “brick” runs about $80 to $1000 and they\\'re pretty much all black. The gun seems infinity useful, but ultimately become a range toy or used for competition. \\n\\n**Home defense**\\n\\nNow, home defense, might be the number one reason people get an AR, but I will always say the best gun for home defense will be anything chambered in 12 gauge. And you can get a semi-auto shotgun with a high capacity magazines, tactical rails, and with any kind of grip or stock you want. I think those are better than an AR15. 12 gauge is so versatile, you can buy the right ammo for the kind of place you live, with more flexibility than what the .223 or 56x45mm has. Where an AR15 will over penetrate and risk hitting neighbors, in a firefight, you can get the exact rounds you need to protect yourself, be effective, and not kill anyone through drywall with 12guage, which you can easily find at in most stores that sell ammo. If you predict your firefight is only going to be defending your apartment from an intruder, then 12 gauge bird shot is  the lethal choice against a human threat and considerate of your neighbor’s safety. Yes, bird shot, despite what experts say. I know what I’m talking about, because I’ve screwed around a lot with 12 gauge bird shot, and at 7 feet you can cut through a 4“x4“ block of wood with the cheap stuff. If you’re not worried about neighbors, you can get slugs or buckshot. So an AR might be a good choice for home defense, but it’s more expensive than the best choice for home defense. \\n\\n**2A:Uprising**\\n\\nIs the AR15 a necessary part of the 2nd amendment? I think the U.S. would collapse before we’d get a chance to overthrow it. But if we did, we’d depend on our military going AWOL first, then we’d have a fighting chance. It also would be bloody. I can’t even imagine what the U.S. would have to be in order for us to get to that point, but I don’t think we have to worry about that any time soon. However, if people want to prep for that, in case they need their AR *later*, I don’t see a problem, but that doesn’t help me argue why people need one *now*.  \\n\\n**2A:Invasion**\\n\\nDoes it owning the AR scare off potential foreign invaders from? Sure, but don’t all of our guns do that? We have 300 million of them. If China was able to invade (lol... let’s pretend, ok?) , they’d have to put up with the locals as they drove down our streets, which would involve vehicle blockades and home made bombs, in addition to guns. \\n\\n**Thanks**\\n\\nHelp me out, guys. I’m stuck on this one. Thank you for taking the time to read this. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I don\\'t believe this is possible without dire consequences that outweigh whatever benefits may exist. There have been quite a few CMVs arguing AGAINST this particular view of mine, including one that was mistitled to make it look like he agreed with me.\\n\\nTo clarify, I\\'m not endorsing the status quo in terms of drug policy. I personally think the drugs that are illegal should be the worst in terms of dependence and bodily harm. For instance, I personally don\\'t use marijuana but I believe it\\'s ridiculous that cannabis use is illegal while alcohol and tobacco, much more harmful and addictive drugs, are legal. This CMV applies to crack, heroin, powder cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, etc. I\\'m opposed to the legalization of drugs that have much higher addiction potential and are much more bodily harmful than drugs that are currently legal. I also do think it’s a good idea to focus more state effort on addiction recovery.\\n\\nThe main argument for the legalization of ALL substances is that it will allegedly curb the power of drug cartels that commit horrendous acts of violence all over the world. I\\'ve heard a lot of vague arguments that we should \"tax and regulate\" these drugs in order to curb abuse while cutting cartel profits. These two goals are generally at odds with each other. Any effective method of undercutting cartels will make hard drugs more available to everyone. You can regulate them all you want, but you’ll only accomplish the intended purpose of cutting profits to drug cartels if you make cocaine and heroin easier to get elsewhere. I believe that there will be more addicts and heavy drug users if this is the case.\\n\\nCurrently, there are more tobacco and alcohol users in the US than marijuana users, and I credit that to the fact that marijuana is illegal and harder to get. This is DESPITE the fact that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful and addictive than marijuana. Sure, you’ll be able to get your hands on it if you really want to, but the law does deter millions. Imagine if cocaine and heroin were sold in stores like tobacco is now. Would you feel safe going to the store knowing that an addict might be holding it up for his fix? Would you feel safe letting your kids go to college, knowing that a senior could purchase them a lifelong addiction and possible early death at the 7-11?\\n\\nI understand that many children already live in an environment where drugs are readily available, but millions of others are stopped from using hard drugs by the presence of the law, and we need to stop and think whether we want to give that away over libertarian principles or possible mitigation of street violence. \\n\\nAs for the libertarian argument that it\\'s a state infringement upon rights, I personally find rights to be a bit more nuanced than that, and the most simply-worded right isn\\'t always the one that should prevail in a given situation. In this case I consider my right to protection from addicts and addictive substances more important than others’ rights to use those substances. There are horrible costs to the “War on Drugs,” but I don’t see any feasible alternative in the realm of legalizing all addictive substances.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Just look at Ferguson. Because the media twisted people\\'s opinions by omitting certain facts, and spinning others in a hugely negative light, it is now almost impossible to even know what the hell happened. The prosecutor himself admitted during the case that a lot of witnesses changed their stories multiple times, usually after being contacted by the media. \\n\\nThe media also helped to incite these riots the first time. They insinuated, long before it was even possible to have all of the facts, that it was nothing more than police brutality and racial profiling. I don\\'t know if it was or wasn\\'t, and I am not here to argue that. But because the media insisted that it was before they could confirm that with facts, citizens across the country, especially in Ferguson, believed it. That helped spark the protests, which, in turn, opened the door to looters taking advantage of the situation and destroying people\\'s lives in the process. \\n\\nI think that if the media were allowed to only present facts that had been verified, and not make any unsubstantiated claims from those, it would go a long way towards making sure this doesn\\'t happen in the future. We still need to know what is going on, which is why the media should be allowed to report. But, at the same time, we need to know what is going on, not what the media wants us to believe went on.\\n\\nEdit - I haven\\'t been ignoring this thread, but I have been in class for the past few hours, and I have class again in a few minutes. I will respond to people as I find time. But I wanted to say in response to people telling me that nothing is certain and you can\\'t know the facts, or the facts are determined by the trial, and hence the legal system. That isn\\'t true. In the ferguson case for example, there were several facts right away. The guy was shot, and he ended up dead. There may, or may not, have been a confrontation between him and the police officer. If there was one it was uncertain who started it. He had just robed a store. etc... They are vague, and don\\'t tell you much of anything. But they are true, and, more importantly, they don\\'t bias the report on the case in any way. If you tell people that the police officer may have started the confrontation then you are biasing them to think it was nothing more than racial profiling and police brutality. If you tell your viewers that the kid started the confrontation, then you are being biased to think the police officer was in the right. By simply stating what happened, and not who did what, you keep the facts and leave the bias.\\n\\n**Edit 2** - My view has been changed, though maybe not in such a way that many of you would have liked. I now agree that outright censoring of the news is bad, even if it is for a good reason. In light of that, I think that there should be regulations on the headlines that news medias use. They can put anything they want in their articles, but their headlines should no longer be so outrageous as to bias your view before even reading the article (stuff like \"Racial profiling grows as cop blatantly shoots black kid in Ferguson, MI yesterday\"). Since teh media can still report whatever they want to, it isn\\'t censoring them, but it does help keep from influencing as many opinions as strongly. I also think that privacy of the people trumps freedom of the press (but thats a personal opinion) and, as such, any and all names should not be allowed in the media period until a decision is reached. It would be enough to say that a cop shot a kid after hearing reports of attempted theft. No names need to be involved. By protecting their identities you are helping to keep their lives intact and protecting them from potential retaliation from people who are upset over the outcome of the trial. This would be as simple as not releasing the names to anyone until the investigation is complete and all facts are gathered. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

People have the choice to deny the job we offer.\"\\n\\nWhich is correct. But also a bit naive. People are prepared to work very hard for very little.

Why, it\\'s not a choice at all! \\n\\nWell, welcome to the situation of a labourer faced with a free market. You have a choice. Kind of. Only it\\'s not a choice at all. \\n\\nIf you truly consider this sort of \"voluntary\" interaction fair, then you must also accept that you have no right to complain about the current status quo.

In my defense, I would point out that a black/hispanic on the other side would be just as affected. With this argument, everyone has a bias and an agenda. \\n\\nFirst the facts:\\n [SAT Scores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States#Bias_against_Asians_and_whites) (Note: while this is in the criticism sections, please only look at the data and not the editorial comments, as to get a non-biased outlook)\\n\\n[Black graduation](http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html) (Note: as this is called the \"Black Journal of Higher Education\", I trust that no one will call me out on using a source that favors my case)\\n\\n       1. Let\\'s address my last claim first: It doesn\\'t improve the \"black condition\" and is unnecessary for the vast majority of blacks/hispanics\\n\\n-This idea is supposed to \"level the playing field\" with all races. All this actually does is passes deserving and intelligent Whites and Asians over for less intelligent and undeserving people in an environment they can\\'t succeed in. For example, [black graduation rates are much lower than white graduation rates.] (http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html) The difference reaches up to +20 points, which is clearly not equality. This disparity is due to affirmative action putting incompetent and undeserving Blacks and Hispanics in college. However, I must make an important clarification. I believe that the vast majority of blacks can succeed in college, and have done so. Affirmative action is not necessary for these kinds of people. The only people affirmative action helps are those who wouldn\\'t be able to get into college otherwise, and by getting them into college, they will only have false expectations and ultimately perform poorly when they realize that college grading is color blind. This is the idea of [mismatching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action#Mismatching) and has been backed up by research. \\n\\n          2. Affirmative action unfairly favors blacks/hispanics over Asians, and thus is racist towards Asians. \\n\\n-Ok, you make the argument that this favoritism towards blacks/hispanics is simply reparations for past transgressions, Jim Crow and the low. Well, Asians have been heavily discriminated against in the past. Jap interment, railroad building, and racial slurs and stereotypes have all been a part of Asian-American history. In fact, I\\'d argue that hispanics have been least discriminated in US history. [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States#Asian_Americans) From this, if you believe that AA is \"payback\" for past actions, defend the favoring of blacks over Asian Americans.\\n\\n           3. Affirmative action is a result of blacks/hispanics that just want to favor their own race. \\n\\nNote: I must admit, for this I have no direct proof, only my anecdotal experience and statements made by others.\\n\\n-Blacks/Hispanics have more political power in this country than Asians, in both positions of government and constituents in voting. Therefore, I believe AA is simply a way to get the black vote/blacks helping out each other. Obviously, being against this political suicide and will get the racist tag labeled in a second. Clarence Thomas, as he is unaffected by these factors as he is appointed and he is black (this is a big factor, a white Justice would get labeled racist), is able to speak out and say that affirmative action is indeed racist, not only towards other races, but blacks themselves. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas#Equal_protection_and_affirmative_action)\\n\\n\\nThis is my case. While I do admit I believe very strongly in my position, I would point out that I have remained civil in my point, provided sources, and made full disclosure in my situation and any opinions not directly proven by facts. Most importantly, I recognize that I am heavily influenced by this topic, and thus may be blinded. I hope we can have a civil discourse.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It is practiced through \\'positive buying\\' in that ethical products are favored, or \\'moral boycott\\', that is negative purchasing and company-based purchasing.\\n\\nIn practice, we can view something like \"Green sourcing\" as an example of this behavior. You go to buy a given good, and find two choices-  one of which is slightly more expensive than the other, but promises that it was produced using \"Sustainable forestry\" or the like. \\n\\nNow, there are several problems with this. \\n\\nFirst of all, given that the \"Green\" option is more expensive at no actual added utility to the end-user, such consumerism is limited more to higher-income people who often buy not just for utility, but for cosmetic luxury and an appearance of being environmentally-friendly. In practice, this means that ethical consumerism is, at best, a mostly-irrelevant niche market, a lonely island in a sea of unethical behavior.\\n\\nSecondly, it puts the impetus on the consumer, not on the corporation to determine the responsible use of resources. A common argument used by libertarians is that issues like climate change and the globalized exploitation of sweatshop labor are self-limiting problems, as people will generally prefer the more humanitarian purchase. In practice, ethical consumerism is used as an excuse to abolish democratically-implemented regulations, leaving huge questions- the environment, workers rights, and the like to the will of a system that inherently values profit over superficial \"ethics\". \\n\\nWhether or not Florida is sunk by rising sea levels is not a triviality that should be left to making sure you buy the right soy sauce.

I believe that life is, in fact, an accident, and that our existence is coincidental. Being so I also don't believe in eternal truths, mainly in the notion that there is an inherent good that people should be trying to attain.\\n\\n If any purpose exists it is constructed within the person, for otherwise, why would people exist? It is not to serve nature, surely, for humans ultimately oppose nature, especially in modern society. In the case that there was a God, I suppose one could argue that we exists for the God's sake, but why? For entertainment? I am really not clear how purpose can be inherent and not constructed. \\n\\nThe same goes for the greater good. There does not seem to be a good that exists from with out the person or societies. If there were a greater\\xa0 objective good, why then, with the exception of murder and incest, are very few things seen as universally bad among all society's? And why are few things seen as universally good? For example, in America it is seen as wrong to arrange a marriage, especially among children under 18. But in many countries that is the standard. If a universal good exists, how come there is so much variance as to what is right and wrong?\\n\\nHowever, I believe this to be a good thing. As opposed to more traditional nihilism which equates meaningless to life being futile, I believe that the lack of a notion of a greater good or purpose, is a freeing thing. With no greater purpose or greater good, one can construct it for oneself. The most important thing becomes one's personal experience in the world, and maximizing that to its full potential. There is no worry of not meeting a cosmic standard; the standards are within yourself. And so, a person does not have to be limited from (most) any experience unless they so desire it.\\n\\nAs such, I would categorize myself as an ethical hedonist: without any inherent purpose, experience is the most important thing, and pleasurable experience being the greatest kind of experience, one should strive for that for themselves. However, because all people are on this journey, one person's search for pleasure cannot infringe on another. I fully believe if everyone felt this way, society would be more functional, as everyone would be operating on the basis of mutual respect. \\n\\n\\nSo Reddit, Change My View, about any and all of these things:\\n1.

A simplified version of this theory (because of the last item) is \"conservatives are motivated by disgust reactions\".\\n\\nMy point is, the problem is that Haidt\\'s methodology is flawed because he assumed the same things will effect a disgust reaction in liberals and conservatives. It is not true. His questions are too much conservative focused e.g. desecrating a flag. Liberals are simply disgusted by different things, for example desecreating knowledge: burning books or libraries.\\n\\nI think liberals feel more disgust over violence and blood for example. It is not simply a care/harm thing, I think perfectly voluntary violence like an MMA match with some blood will disgust liberals more than conservatives.\\n\\nSimilarly ask them about how they feel about shooting a dog who is in incurable pain and debilitating disability (and therefore it is a caring, not harmful act), liberals will feel more disgusted by it.\\n\\nSo if you balance your questions properly, you take into account different kinds of disgust, you don\\'t find liberals are less motivated by disgust than conservatives.\\n\\nSimilarly, it is not that liberals are less likely to respect authority, but more like they respect different authorities: the police less, and scientists more.\\n\\nIn loyalty Haidt focuses too much on loyalty to your nation or family and not your political movement or social class. \\n\\nMy view is that with properly balanced questionnaires that take into account that (US) liberals and conservatives are upset by different things, these differences would disappear. \\n\\nIn other words that it is mostly useless.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, I just started a job at an anesthesiologist billing office that uses a company in India to do their data entry (a LOT of anesthesiologists use our service so there's a lot of data entry) and it got me thinking that there's nothing actually wrong with outsourcing aside from just the potential poor quality, but my work really benefits from it and they do a good job. \\n\\nThe call centers I used to deal with at the airline would often try to hide the fact that they were outsourced.

Obviously music enjoyment is not some scientific enterprise.  There is music that I don\\'t enjoy listening to, but understand how others could or see quality that I can appreciate.  Likewise, everyone has those guilty pleasure artists/songs where we know they\\'re bad, but love them anyway.  In either case, there is something *about* the music that we find good, whether an infectious melody or well-constructed lyrics or a wailing solo.\\n\\nWhich returns me to trap.  I find nothing about it aesthetically or musically appealing.  I can\\'t relegate it to \"I\\'m not into it, but can see why others do\" because I can\\'t see why others like it, which is why I turn to you, Reddit.  My objections are as follows:\\n\\n(1) Minimalism works against it.  Minimalism in music is not always bad.  I listen to other Electrohouse or DnB artists who use it to great effect.  It creates a great tension-and-release element to a song and when used well is orgasmic.  This tension is a staple in the Trap \"sound\", replacing the forceful Dubstep drop for a super low drone with a high minimalistic melody (generally speaking).  On an subjective level, this is musical blue balls, but I think I can make a case for this on a more objective level.  The reason the EDM staple of build-drop works is because of the tension-release cycle.  It\\'s like those amusement park rides that take you up 300 feet and then, well, drop you.  The exhilaration and force of the drop is sharpened by the slow buildup.  Trap, on the other hand, employs an almost identical build, and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience.  Imagine if instead of dropping the full 300 feet, the ride drops you 50 feet.  You dont expect the stop and theres this juxtaposition of released tension and even more anticipation.  Trap as a genre embraces this latter example as its core, never rleasing the tension fully.  As a result, instead of effectively building a proper tension-release cycle, Trap leaves the listener unfulfilled.\\n\\nPossible rebuttal to (1): The amusement park model doesn\\'t work for Trap.  In that case, what is a better model with which to consider Trap?\\n\\n(2) Absence of complexity.  I\\'m not looking for Mozart the DJ.  Just something that gives the illusion of compositional knowhow.  1-3 note melodies are firstly boring and secondly a sign that the producer has no musical talent.  I would like skill in my music.  Trap as a genre feeds the instrumental-fetishist argument that electrobic music takes no skill because they don\\'t play a \"real instrument\".  EDM can do so much more, and I\\'ve heard it do so much more.  Just never in this genre.\\n\\nPossible rebuttal to (2): (a)You\\'re just being a snob and using it as an excuse for your subjective dislike.  Possibly, but I don\\'t think so.  Even if the bar were set really low (like One Direction low) maybe the best choruses of Trap (that are distinctly Trap, not simply elements of other EDM genres which automatically set the majority of trap above 1D) could surpass them in terms of quality.  Maybe. (b)Other genres have plenty of unremarkable musical complexity.  Agreed; however no genre (aside from Ambient Drone) makes melodic simplicity a defining feature of the genre itself.  (c) Simplicity is not always bad.  Agreed.  Some composers use simplicity very well and for a variety of aesthetic effects.  My argument is that Trap does not.\\n\\nIt\\'s likely that I won\\'t enjoy Trap music after this thread, but I do want to understand those that do like it, and if they like it, whether they actually think it constitutes quality music.  Thank you.\\n\\nEdit1: Formatting\\n\\nEdit2: This is not \"CMV: We can make objective judgments about aesthetic matters\".  My view includes as a presupposition that there is an objective (but limited) element to the appreciation of music.\\n\\nEdit3: I am referring to \"Second Wave\" characterized by heavy electronic music influences, rather than the original Trap which was a Hip-Hop offshoot.\\n\\nEdit4: Examples incoming\\n\\nExample 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZB_tXP84WU This is a fairly standard (in my mind) example of Trap elements.  808 steady drone with high-hats composing the background for a melody of, lets face it, one note with some ornaments.\\n\\nExample 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t_eU3tdy2g Remix also including elements mentioned above.  Better than most, but only just.\\n\\nExample 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL9OzPY4byQ Changing up the formula a little with this one.  The downtempo nature brings something different to the table, and its minimalism actually contributes to its overall feel.  Definitely not the norm, though.\\n\\nExample 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYBLylKa-vI  10 songs that could serve as an adequate standard for what I mean by \"Trap\".

The karma system allows one \\'group\\' to impose their beliefs on another with a, \"whose side has more people who believe [in] this,\" kind of numbers game. It always comes down to the fact that if the hive-mind does not completely agree with your opinion, your post will simply be buried deep within the bellows of the website and very little discussion will ever be had about it.  \\n\\nEvery Redditor knows that saying things that are generally unpopular with the majority of Reddit can mean an infinite amount of karma loss and possible continuous harassment. For example, I remember a while back (I do not have a link, sorry.) of a Redditor who posted something negative about Jennifer Lawrence. He made a meme soon after explaining something about it, and then I eventually seen a Bad Luck Brian meme about him several days later because every comment he ever made (or close to) was downvoted into oblivion and he was harassed non-stop. His having a different opinion than the hive-mind pretty much destroyed his account. \\n\\nSomething very similar happened to me once before as well when I was new to the website. I posted what is generally a very unpopular opinion on Reddit, before I was aware that it was, because it is my personal belief. The topic was the legalization of marijuana for recreational uses and I was hoping for some discussion about it because I had asked a question to another Redditor as to why he felt the way he did towards it being legalized, something I am personally against. I asked why he was pro-legalization, stated one reason I am against it, and told him that his story had made my day. I did not attack his opinion, I did not downvote him (I  upvoted him in fact because I enjoyed the story he wrote), and I had no ill intentions whatsoever. \\n\\nInstead of some sort of civil discussion and my question being answered, what I got was overly defensive comments (not from him, he did not reply) calling me an idiot just for having that opinion, downvotes that never seemed to end on that comment until I deleted it, being attacked for every little thing related or otherwise, and no real discussion to be had. I was practically *forced* to delete that comment because of the non-stop harassment if I wanted to continue using my account. My comment also was not to just incite an argument seeing as how there was others saying how it should just be legalized in the other comments already and this was not a marijuana related subreddit I.E (/r/trees). It was /r/askreddit and the topic of legalization had already been present before I had posted that I was against it.\\n\\nReddit is supposed to be a discussion board and website where people share their opinions, something nobody should be harassed for. Harassment of those with controversial opinions continues and is something I regularly see being mentioned on subreddits like /r/offmychest. If so few are willing to truly have a discussion and instantly take to this numbers game, then what point is there in even posting your opinion if it\\'s not what the collective wants to see? The karma system buries what you said or posted, essentially making it absolutely pointless. Intellectual conversation and debate on a topic is difficult when opinion is valued more than the quality of the post itself.\\n\\nSo please, change my view.\\n\\nEDIT: My Internet took a dive last night so I just decided to go to bed.

At the moment, the year is split up into twelve chunks, but they\\'re not quite equal, their lengths appear to have no logical order aside from summing to 365 or 366, and one of them has a different length every 4 years. Whenever we refer to the frequency of an event as, say, \"once a month\", we could just as easily say that it\\'s \"once every 30 days\".\\n\\n*Clarification: I\\'m saying that as it is, \"once a month\" is very imprecise anyway since months have varying lengths. For anything that can be this arbitrary, \"once every 30 days\" works just as well.*\\n\\nLeap years would also be extremely simple; instead of adding a day to a particular month, a day could just be added to a year. The year would then go up to Day 366 instead of Day 365.\\n\\n**Here\\'s an example of why I think a calendar without months would be easier.**\\n\\nSuppose it\\'s Saturday, September 20th, or Day 263. Let\\'s suppose I wanted to figure out what day of the week December 5th (Day 339) would be.\\n\\nTo figure it out in my head using the current months system, I would have to go through the following procedure (which could probably be reduced a bit, but not greatly):\\n\\n9/20 is a Saturday\\n\\n9/27 is a Saturday\\n\\n9/30 is a Tuesday\\n\\n10/7 is a Tuesday\\n\\n10/28 is a Tuesday\\n\\n10/31 is a Friday\\n\\n11/7 is a Friday\\n\\n11/28 is a Friday\\n\\n11/30 is a Saturday\\n\\n12/7 is a Saturday\\n\\n12/5 is a Friday\\n\\nOn the other hand, if I wanted to figure out the same thing using a \"numbered-day system\", it would be simple:\\n\\n(Day 339)-(Day 263)=(76 days)=6 days (mod 7).\\n\\nTherefore, Day 339 is 6 days later than a Saturday, so it\\'s a Friday.\\n\\n**EDIT: /u/chewy628 sort of changed my view by referencing the [International Fixed Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar), which uses many of the same ideas I expressed here while making it less math-intensive.

While still in foster care, the state allowed a sexual reassignment surgery on the child. They removed his penis &amp; testicles. The child now identifies as male. His parents are suing the state.\\n\\nThe comments section on this post was overwhelmingly filled with rage against the state for performing what some term \"mutilation\" on this child, as well as countless comparisons to [David Reimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer). I am baffled by the response to the article and disagree with the Reimer comparison, so I would like my view changed.\\n\\nFor starters, I think Reimer is completely irrelevant to the case at hand. He was born male and his sex change was the result of a botched circumcision. He then suffered bizarre forms of so-called \"therapy\" that included a doctor forcing him and his twin brother to rehearse sexual acts. We can all agree this whole situation is fucked up and should serve as a lesson for all medical professionals. But I don\\'t see why that implies sex reassignment surgery on children is inherently evil.\\n\\nUnlike Reimer, this child was not born with a single sex and then reassigned to a different one.  He also wasn\\'t forced into traumatic pseudoscientific behavioral therapy. From what I read, it sounds like he was raised like any normal girl would be. I think the comparisons to Reimer are an example of the Reddit hivemind desperately seeking comparisons for what they perceive to be medical malpractice.\\n\\nI\\'m certainly open to being convinced Reimer\\'s case is relevant, but it\\'s not the important part of my view.\\n\\nAs stated in the title, I don\\'t see anything wrong with what the doctors in this case did. The child was born with both sets of genitals and they made the decision he should be a girl. Let\\'s look at some alternative scenarios.\\n\\nFirst, if the child identified as female we would not be discussing it. I suspect this type of surgery happens quite often and the child grows up like any other member of their assigned gender. It\\'s functionally the same as if they had been born that way.\\n\\nIf the intersex child hadn\\'t received surgery, he would have grown up with ambiguous genitalia. Then he could have decided at a later time to be male, female, or whatever, along with the corresponding surgery or lack thereof. This is what all the commenters say should have happened, and it\\'s what I disagree with.\\n\\nI can only speculate on what that life would be like (so if you have experienced this personally you can probably change my view quite easily) but it sounds pretty terrible to me. Growing up is hard enough, especially dealing with body and gender issues. I\\'m not saying you should be embarrassed to be intersex, but that doesn\\'t mean I wouldn\\'t have been embarrassed about it if I were 12 years old and my genitals didn\\'t look like anyone else\\'s. And much as I think our society\\'s gender roles are too rigid and need to be loosened, it doesn\\'t change the fact that identifying with a particular gender makes puberty much easier.\\n\\nWorst of all, I can\\'t imagine having both sets of genitals and identifying as a specific gender. That leaves you with the choice of getting major surgery as an adult (as a guy, the thought of getting my dick cut off even for such an important part of my life sounds horrific) or being stuck in a body you don\\'t feel comfortable in.\\n\\nNote that in the case in question the child doesn\\'t identify as intersex: he identifies as male. If he had both sets of genitals, he would currently be as unhappy as he is with just a vagina. The only difference is apparently FTM surgery is much harder than MTF, but that just tells me the doctors should have made him a male at birth (so he had the option to become female later) rather than leaving him intersex.\\n\\nTherefore if I was born intersex I would rather have gender ~~re~~assignment surgery ASAP. If doctors make the right choice, great. If they make the wrong choice, I\\'m no different from any other trans person.\\n\\nBy the way, I\\'m not saying intersex infants should *have* to receive surgery. If the parents want to raise their child intersex, I guess that\\'s their choice just like they\\'re free to raise a child with a penis as a girl. I think such parents would be making a shitty choice, and if my parents did that I would be mad at them, but again I\\'m not going to bother arguing any surgery should be mandatory. I\\'m just saying it\\'s not inherently wrong to perform the surgery.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Try as I might, I just can\\'t see how at least the first part of the statement could be false. I present this in the true spirit of CMV, I feel like I might be missing something.\\n\\nMy particular view is that in a number of Disney movies, the heroes skins are Caucasian and the villains skins are shades of dark (brown, purple, grey), and that this creates an association between evil and dark skin that children pick up very easily. There are plenty of Disney movies where this is not the case, but there are enough that it is an issue: Aladdin, Lion King, Little Mermaid, Mulan, Hercules (probably more).\\n\\nBeyond this obvservation, there are a variety of arguments that many Disney movies are racist:\\n\\n* [An article](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/06/repressed-brits-evil-mexicans-arab-villains-hollywood-animated-movies-stereotypes) from the Guardian detailing the history, mainly from a stereotype + voice actor\\'s race angle.\\n\\n* [A listicle](http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/05/most-racist-moments-disney-movies-cartoons/) with plenty of video links, some back to the 20s &amp; 30s. Is there anyone that will argue that even these are not harmfully racist? And if they are harmfully racist, at which point did the racism disappear or become benign?\\n\\n* [Diversity in Disney Films](http://www.amazon.com/Diversity-Disney-Films-Ethnicity-Disability/dp/0786446013/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415665430&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=disney+race) - a collection of Essays.\\n\\n* [Several more books](http://www.amazon.com/Diversity-Disney-Films-Ethnicity-Disability/dp/0786446013/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415665430&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=disney+race) on Amazon.\\n\\nSo, where are the well reasoned arguments that these depictions are not racist? I think there is some fundamental disagreement between my friend and I on the way meaning is created and, thus, how media works. For her, the \"darkness\" evoking evil stops there, it is only incidental that skin is being used as the pallet. (She goes on to joke about blue people being offended by Genie, etc...) \\n\\nFurther, she believes that the model is just too simple. That the mechanisms of racism are much more complicated than this belief allows and that it is this kind of thinking that leads to rampant Political Correctness. This is possibly why I am most interested in this argument. I find many arguments that lead to rampant PC to be compelling, but I certainly detest the world in which we are all policing each other for racial, feminist, etc.. correctness.\\n\\nFor me, it naturally follows that if these characters are teaching negative stereotypes about race, then they are harmful to children as they learn about the world. If you agree that the movies are racist, but that they don\\'t have that big of an impact on children, I\\'d be interested in those arguments as well.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'m much more interested in scholarly or at least well-studied arguments than how you personally \"feel\" about the subject without deep consideration. I will gladly devour any links you have to support your arguments.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I believe it was on of the biggest shocks to my personal views on the world. All my life I suffered from lack of sexual/social success, I wasn't confident, I didn't know how to deal with people around me and I basically reverted to being a nice guy, which is something people &amp; pop-culture advocates through advice, movies, selective presentation by the media and so forth. \\n\\nWhen I was introduced to the PUA community 2 years ago, and eventually TRP a few months ago, it was the first time in my life I was given helpful advice on how to become someone who can actually make it in today's society in terms of being social/sexual. Those communities taught me about confidence, staying true to myselfself, embracing my sexuality and most of all become the best version of myself and aim for the stars, in a way that is actually applicable to the real world, and not in the form of some cliched advice that people oblivious to those concepts could possibly grasp and implement.\\n\\nI do agree with a lot of statements regarding TRP making generalizations about women, to a point of de-humanizing them. But on the other hand, there is no other community that gives you genuine advice on how to become that successful person you always wanted to be and reach your goals in life, and I sincerely believe that someone who will ignore the MRA-oriented side of TRP and focus on the advice they give on self-improvement (as proven mostly true by people's 'Field Reports'), will prosper beyond his imagination and there's no competition in that field. The world is a harsh place full of mostly ego-centric people that will not reach out for people with that kind of weaknesses, and one must seek it out in places like TRP to have a chance of actually bettering theirselves.\\n\\nThe reason I believe that is by looking at facts :\\n\\nBefore being exposed to the PUA community and TRP : I had no courage to even talk to a girl I had interest in, was socially awkward and was made fun of most of my teenage years. This applies to a lot of men my age who you could see for a fact that didn't even know how to deal with those kind of issues and suddenly it's like they swallowed a magic pill.\\n\\nAfter : Learned to take the initiative and lead the interaction (as directly suggested by those communities), take responsibility for sexual escalation (which doing only half-assed while not being experienced always turned girls off), and finally lost my virginity. Also, I am generally much more confident, got rid of most of my depressive nature and people actually like to be around me way more than before. \\n\\nChange my view.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n\", 'op-title': \"CMV: People keep dismissing TRP, but it's the best path to take for a man's self-improvement.\", 'pair_ids': ['p_271'], 'train': 1})}),\n",

This story is not all that unique, as there are plenty of instances when older women, often teachers, have been arrested for having sex with males under the age of consent. And while I don't necessarily think that women in these cases should not be punished at all, I think punishing them as much as older men who prey on young girls is also not appropriate.\\n\\nI don't think it's a controversial statement to say that males are naturally more sexually aggressive and promiscuous than females. That is seen across cultures and even across species. Simply put, men want sex more than women, they just do. Sure 14 or 15 year old boys may not have the mental and/or emotional capability to fully consent to sex, but pretending that boys at that age don't want sex is completely disingenuous -- and so is pretending that girls by and large are as driven by sexual motives as boys. Furthermore, adolescent boys are often physically bigger and stronger than older women, so feelings of coercion in that respect are not as pronounced if the genders were switched. \\n\\nSo, please, explain to me why there shouldn't be a double standard in this scenario.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I know that the *real* purpose of a government is to protect certain values that a society believes are rights of the citizens (it is the government's job to ensure that the food is safe, or that some random business allows for equal opportunity) - I understand that.  \\n\\n**Here's my general point.**  There is not a single example of a government organization working with greater efficiency than a corporate or private-sector competitor.  This could be post office/UPS (the post office in USA loses tons of money, has too many stores, etc.), public works for cities VS independent salting/road repair companies, or even the entirety of the US military VS Blackwater (Blackwater never had a single failed mission in Iraq).  These are just some examples I can think of at the moment, but it seems like every time the government attempts to provide a material, money-handling service, they do a very poor job at keeping it efficient.  And to juxtapose their inefficiency, there are corporations working in the exact same sectors making lots of money (USPS vs UPS).\\n\\n\\nHere is a good example of what I think would better serve the nation.  Instead of having the TSA at every airport harassing your grandmother because their inept ability to identify, why shouldn't the government just publish a certain set of standards that need to be met by each airport security checkpoint, then each airport hires a private security firm?

I\\'m an engineer and most of my jobs are 1-2 year contracts for large corporations. I\\'m not high up the corporate ladder but the salary is high enough to cover all my material needs plus save about 30% for retirement.\\n\\n**1**- I know that if I worked a lot harder, I would have the chance to be promoted to a director position, but I don\\'t see the point. The net wage would be 20-30% higher, but I would have to sacrifice more than 30% of my time&amp;energy for the corporation.  Also, in my field director positions seem less safe than manager positions. Directors cost more and are the first people to be laid off when there is a restructuring.\\n\\n**2**- I cannot take my achievements to the grave.  To me, life is not about achievements but about experiences. Achievements are just a means to an end, which is having awesome experiences. There is a case to be made that social status itself is an \"experience\" worth pursuing, but corporate titles don\\'t really impress the people closest to me. They only impress people I don\\'t like and don\\'t care about. \\n\\n**3**- There certainly are situations where hard work is worth it, but working for a corporation is not one of them.

The first is that money in courts is a fundamental miscarriage of justice. When I see cases where a drunk kid kills people, but their rich parents get them off with their crack team of lawyers, or a powerful corporation destroys a regular person or small business with a costly court case on extremely weak grounds because the small business can't afford to fight back, I am sickened. Equality in the eyes of the law is in my opinion the single most important part of our society, and in the current system, the rich and the poor are not equal in the eyes of the law.\\n\\nThe second part of my view is that a good solution to this problem is to require that both sides in a lawsuit or court case contribute equally to their own legal team and their opponents. I've thought long and hard about this, and this is the best thing I can come up with. Other attempts to bring equality to courts that I've seen all fall short somewhere. The loser paying the winner's legal fees doesn't help, because it only takes place after the end of the lawsuit, and large corporations win by dragging on a suit until the small business runs out of money and has to give up. Preventing money from entering the courts in the first place doesn't work, because some issues actually are complex and nuanced and require lots of lawyer's time to analyse. Having each party contribute equally to their own and their opponents legal fees ensures that complex cases can be sorted out as long as one party is willing to pay for it, it ensures that both sides are equal in the eyes of the law, and it solves the problems I brought up earlier. In the case of he rich parents paying to get their drunk-driving son off easy, they would be forced to contribute an equal amount to the state's case, allowing the state to effectively fight back, and it prevents large corporations bleeding small entities dry, because the small entities aren't using their own money anymore.\\n\\nEssentially, the legal system has in some cases been turned into a weapon, and this proposal would turn it back into what it should be: a way to determine wrongdoing.\\n\\nOne note: Don't try to change my view that this can't be done because it is a restriction on freedom without first trying to convince me that freedom is more important than equality. I believe that equality is more important than freedom and I'm totally willing reduce freedom in exchange for an increase in equality, within reason.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Unless you live on a farm or directly hunt your meat, not a single animal is saved. By the time you reject a burger, your rejection pretty much only affects you. \\n\\n\\nHowever that doesn't mean there is no reason to be a vegetarian or to care. One reason is, if you are personally so disturbed by knowing what you are eating that you genuinely don't want meat. That is great, but we can agree that is a personal reason that might help better you as an individual but won't help the world. \\n\\n\\nOnly remaining reason would be contributing to a trend. If restaurants keep getting vegetarian requests they might actually start ordering less meat, and that will culminate and the difference might be felt. However, it is more likely that while they will develop a better vegetatarian offer, the need for meat will only keep increasing with the growing number of population, and contributing to the trend of not eating meat at all won't do any difference. \\n\\n\\nHowever, there is a different trend that many meat eaters are getting behind as well, and that is caring about where your meat is from and whether the animals were ethically treated. Many people aren't able to give up meat, but they do care about animals. If you go behind this trend, you might contribute to making a difference. A restaurant that would otherwise just leave their meat as it is and make a vegetarian option, after hearing enough people ask about where the meat is from, might totally change their meat suppliers. That is a big difference. \\n\\nThe trend would push farms to be more humane if selling otherwise becomes difficult. For a local place, being the fifth regular who cares about this could even be enough to make a difference. \\n\\nIt just seems like the next realistic goal is getting behind demanding better treatment for animals, and that can be achieved if the intended consumers of the meat make these demands.

If someone were to talk to me, I assume they would classify me as an atheist, as I do not think that there is a continuation of any sort after death.  Some say that life is important and life matters BECAUSE it ends, which is a beautiful thought in my head; however, I can't get behind it because nothing is permanent.  For example, why does it matter whether someone acts justly and is a good person versus acting vile and offensive?  I'm not saying that we should all be dicks to each other, but what I am saying is that in the long run, there will be no evidence of someone acting either way.  Most people will be completely forgotten within 100 years of their death.  I used to believe that I should strive to be one of the lucky few who should rise above and do something so great that they are remembered indefinitely.  Nowadays, I realize that this was a stupid thought because on a long enough timeline, everything that everyone has ever done will be lost. (When the sun explodes or even if some of us survive that when some sort of cosmic event destroys every part of the universe we are a part of.  OR even simply when the human race becomes extinct or if we evolve when all of the branches of the tree that came from us falls to extinction).  After that, I felt that helping people mattered, because even if I couldn't be remembered, I could still have an effect on people's lives in a positive manner and that has to count for something; however, if everyone who you helped is one day going to be long gone, and every inkling of evidence that you or anyone you ever came into contact with even existed will be gone from the universe, then what is the point?  How does anything matter?\\n\\nThat being said, I recognize that if nothing matters, than perhaps because of that fact, maybe, just maybe, everything is important. Perhaps every single blade of grass, moment in time, leaf in the wind is infact important. This is the point of view that I would like to adopt, but right now, it seems that it takes too much faith and not enough logic for me to take the step into this mindset.  If anyone has this mindset or has someway for me to rationalize this view, please, feel free to comment.\\n\\nLastly, I would like to keep this thread on topic.

And I recognize that human activity appears to be the main driver of it.  But I don't think the consequences will be as dire as are portrayed for humanity.  In the following, most of my source material is going to come from the IPCC, which is I think a fairly good source for data on this, and if anything has an institutional bias in the direction of warning of dire consequences.\\n\\nThere are ~~four~~three avenues that I think are of primary concern:\\n\\n* Sea level rise.  [The IPCC estimates](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/unfccc/cop19/3_gregory13sbsta.pdf) a sea level rise in the range of 0.5m over the next century.  While that's not trivial, it's also not dire.  Most coastal communities can manage that level of rise with levees and sea walls.  Occasionally someone shows a map with a city like New York or Miami under a 3 or 4 meter rise in sea levels, but the IPCC estimates give that a very low probability of happening.\\n\\n* Drought and other negative impacts on agricultural production.  I do not deny that some areas will see reduced rainfall, but I don't think that can be true for everywhere (indeed, it would seem like higher aggregate temperatures would result in more atmospheric water vapor and more aggregate rainfall).  So while some areas may be negatively impacted, others will be positively impacted.  Further, we've been getting progressively more efficient agriculturally as time goes on.  Across the world, the amount of agricultural land per capita has been falling for decades, and in developed nations, where population growth is slow, is falling in absolute terms.  See pg. 502 in [this IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter8.pdf)  This [other report](https://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/publications/SAR/SAR_Chapter%2013.pdf) on the impact of climate change on crop output says, with what's described as medium confidence that:\\n&gt;Global agricultural production can be maintained relative to base production under climate change as expressed by general circulation models under doubled CO2 equilibrium climate scenarios.\\n\\n* Severe weather events.  While I don't deny that global warming can cause more severe weather events such as hurricanes, I question whether this is a very dire consequence.  As our weather forecasting improves, and our disaster preparedness improves, the loss of life from weather events falls.  Even a very bad storm like Katrina was not nearly as devastating to human life as a storm [with no warning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1900_Galveston_hurricane) 100 years before.  Further, the IPCC [expresses low confidence](http://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf) (page 6 of that source) that the number of tropical cyclones is measurably impacted by climate change.  It's a plausible hypothesis, but not one that seems to have been proven yet.\\n\\nSo the reason I am looking to see my view possibly changed on this is that I often see people proposing dire consequences and accordingly drastic action, of the type that will massively impact standards of living, especially among people in developing nations, where energy is an enormous part of people's daily budgets.  I don't see the consequences of warming as being severe enough to justify those drastic measures, and would like to know if there's something I'm missing.  Also, I'm primarily concerned with the impact on humans.  While certainly we have to live in the natural environment, and so it matters that the environment is in decent shape, I see it as more an instrumentality to human wellbeing, not an end in itself.\\n\\nFor a bit of background, I'm not a climate scientist and don't have any particular area of expertise in this, though I do have a fairly high base level of scientific knowledge and am open to fairly technical rebuttals.\\n\\nEdits: fixed a link up and forgot I'd consolidated my list.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Here are my two exceptions where I feel it is the fault of the door-opener:\\n\\n1. When the driver or passengers leave the vehicle when it is not in a proper parking spot. This is an illegal time to open the door anyway. I\\'ve seen videos taken in New York of Taxi passengers being like \"this is the best spot to get out, even though my Taxi is still in the middle of the road\", and then BAM. Door prize. This is the passenger\\'s fault.\\n\\n2. When the driver opens the door into a **marked** bike lane (without ensuring it is safe to do so). Note: if the bike lane is positioned correctly, it should never be within the door range of a parked car anyway, so this situation *should* never exist, but in reality it sometimes does exist. In the situations where it does exist, I think that since the driver had to safely cross a **marked** bike lane to park their car, it should be incredibly obvious that they need to be careful when opening their door on the way out. That\\'s why in this situation I think it\\'s the fault of the door-opener.\\n\\nNow on to my arguement. First off, I do cycle on the road in a decent size city from time to time (I used to do it full time), so I am sympathetic to the plights of cyclists. I\\'m not just an ignorant driver yelling from my spot of comfort.\\n\\n(When I do ride, I feel like I ride in a very safe, patient, predictable fashion. For example, I don\\'t pass by cars stopped at intersections because I don\\'t feel that it is reasonable for them to be expected to see me. I\\'ll sit directly behind them in line with their license plate, and I\\'ll let them do what they are doing without me making an erratic, sudden, unexpected pass. If I can\\'t get directly behind them, I\\'ll still let them turn right or left or whatever without darting in front of them or near them. Cars have many blind spots and motorists can\\'t be reasonably expected to check all of them all the time as well as monitor what\\'s in front of them *while* making a turn. Not even the best, most-attentive driver in the world could do so. Therefore, I ride the way I do not only to keep myself safe, but to make life easier and less stressful on motorists. We\\'re all in this together.)\\n\\nDoor-prizing is probably the best example of cyclists having an attitude like \"People have to watch out for me in *blank* situation! I\\'m not at all going to help them not make a mistake in *blank* situation just because I\\'m not legally required to do so even though I could make the same mistake if I was them.\". I understand how in the law it is written that a motorist must always open their door only when it is safe to do so. However, I do not agree with this law as I do not feel that is it reasonable to blame a driver for opening his or her door into the path of a cyclist. Here\\'s why:\\n\\n1. Even the best, most attentive driver can miss a cyclist that is riding close enough to be door-prized. You can shoulder check, mirror check, or whatever. If a cyclist is within only a few feet of that side of your car and coming fast, then they can be difficult to see until it\\'s too late. This is especially true if they are riding parallel with your driver side tires when you are making your checks and then they suddenly turn out to go around you when you go to open the door.\\n\\n2. Pedestrians are expected to cross at crosswalks. Why?  Because a driver can\\'t be expected to monitor for pedestrians that are crossing at every part of the road from every direction, so we put the crosswalks at certain parts of the roads so that the drivers know where to expect pedestrians. Similarly, it\\'s just as reasonable to say, \"cyclists, it is illegal for you to ride in the range of the doors because it\\'s not reasonable for drivers to expect you to be on simply any part of the road you want. You have to be where they expect traffic. They don\\'t expect traffic right next to them when they are parked.\"\\n\\n3. The cyclist, for their own safety, should not be riding in range of the doors. They are doing something incredibly dangerous by riding in the door range of parked cars. If someone is doing something incredibly dangerous, and someone hurts them as a result, then often the person who hurts them should not be held at fault. I feel this is one of those situations.\\n\\n4. Door-prizing a cyclist is a mistake anyone can easily make, and it\\'s **much** easier to teach the cyclist not to ride in the door-prize lane than it is to teach the driver to ensure that every single time they open their door they need to spend the 2 to 3 seconds to do their best to make sure no cyclist is about to dangerously pass them (even if the driver is preoccupied, in a rush, distracted by a child wanting to get out of the car, etc.). Keep in mind you\\'re not just teaching drivers, you\\'d have to teach children too because anyone can be opening one of the doors on that side of the car. Also, I think you\\'d be dishonest with me if you say that every single time you open your car door you are 100% aware of what\\'s next to you. You\\'re lucky that there was never an irresponsible cyclist those times that you did.\\n\\n\\nFinally a cyclist might argue \"sometimes I need to cycle in the \\'door-prize lane\\' because there\\'s not enough room for cars to pass me if I ride further to the left\". In that situation you should simply \"take the lane\", which means that you ride in the centre of the lane so cars cannot pass you. This is 100% legal; you are still riding as far to the right as is safe to do so. If there are cars parked along the side of the road, then the traffic on that road is likely slow enough that you will have little trouble \"taking the lane\". If cars need to pass and you\\'d prefer to not have them sit behind you, you can move over into the \"door-prize lane\" and **stop** and wait until it\\'s reasonable to move into the regular traffic lane again.\\n\\n**EDIT:** Thanks for your opinions everyone. I gotta go to sleep. Some of you made some good points and caused me to rethink my opinion, see new flaws in my opinion, and see how that there are situations where my opinion is bullshit  (NYC, Large British Cities), but I still think my opinion is the more perfect of the two imperfect solutions (i.e. always blame the door-opener or blame the door opener in certain situations only). Also, I\\'m not so douchy and opinionated in normal life, just for you guys :P\\n\\n**EDIT 2:** I\\'m not conceding my opinion! However, a PSA: please be careful when opening your door. You are also legally responsible if you open your door in a parking stall when if someone pulls in next to you. I think The Netherlands trains drivers to open their door with their right hand so that they are forced to turn around when they open it. Might be a worthwhile habit pick up!\\n\\n**EDIT 3:** Because I like hearing my own voice. Cyclists: You can take the lane. I\\'m surprised by the number of people who don\\'t know this.  Just because motorists have to slow down for you that doesn\\'t mean you are doing something illegal. Take the lane if to do otherwise is to ride in an unsafe position on the road. Here\\'s an excellent reference: [LINK](http://www.bikexprt.com/streetsmarts/usa/). Pay particular attention to [LINK](http://www.bikexprt.com/streetsmarts/usa/chapter2a.htm). Don\\'t hesitate to inconvenience drivers *if* *to* *do* *otherwise* *is* *to* *compromise* *your* *safety*. I\\'m not saying go out of your way to be an asshole, just know that your safety is more valuable than someone else saving a few seconds. Regardless, motorists should be patient. They have a nice comfy seat and nice tunes in a nice warm, dry car. They can wait a second or 30 if it means you are safe. If they honk, ignore it. If they get out of their car, pedal away. If they pull out a gun, holy shit. (I\\'m speaking as someone who is both a cyclist and a motorist. I\\'m not just a douchy cyclist who feels they are entitled to the road.)\\n\\n**EDIT 4:** I made some points in the comments that I think are very effective in explaining why I think the way I do.

My nation (the United States) has a long history of controversy in regards to marriage. Up until [1967](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia), inter-racial marriage was illegal in many states. Today, I suspect, most of the public supports the legality of inter-racial marriage. Since [1862](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrill_Anti-Bigamy_Act) Plural marriages (known mostly for the practice's association with the Mormon church) has been illegal. Then, of course, in recent years there's been the controversy over gay marriage - George W. Bush putting [opposition into law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act) and over course his successor, Barack Obama, pushing in the opposite direction. \\n\\nPersonally, I just don't see why these issues are any business of the government. During the debate over gay marriage, the 'slippery slope' argument was often cited - that if you legalize gay marriage, next thing you know women will be wanting to marry a zebra or something. Personally, I say if the Zebra can sign the documents and take the vows, who am I to stand in the way of love? Frankly, I don't see it as my business.\\n\\nThe issue of plural marriage is more controversial; it's been associated with abuse, forced marriage, sexual assault of minors. But to my mind, it would be more sensible to pass laws against abuse, forced marriage, and sexual assault than to ban plural marriage - which does not inherently include any of this. \\n\\nMy opinion is this: I see no advantage and significant disadvantage to Government regulation of marriage. The marriage contract, at it's heart, is just a civil contract that comes with tax incentives and a few other incentives, such as inheritance rights and the ability to visit loved ones in the hospital. This contract should be governed by the people who want to enter into it, and subject to no more or less restriction and oversight than other contracts. \\n \\nI invite you to change my view\\n\\n*Full disclosure: I am currently in a polyamorous relationship with a partner I would very much like to marry some day, but who also has another partner whom she would also like to marry someday.

However, I believe these are offset and outnumbered by the tyranny and atrocities committed under non-democratic governments.\\n\\nWhen I say this I mean that I believe comparing modern and past democracies to modern and past dictatorships and monarchies throughout history will yield the conclusion that the quality of life in a democracy is substantially better for most people and that as more people are given franchise the better and better it gets.  Conversely if, for example, the U.S. had been a one-party dictatorship for the past 200+ years, atrocities such as chattel slavery, genocide of indigenous peoples, and unwarranted global intervention would be that much worse (if imagining such is even possible.)\\n\\nI want to clarify that I am using the U.S. as my main example because that\\'s where I am, also I think it is a good example of a particularly controversial example of democracy.\\n\\nI believe that one of the biggest problems with American democracy to date is the ambivelence people have towards democracy.  Judging even just from the posts on this sub many are incredibly disappointed with democracy and will even go as far as to say it is \"obsolete\" or just a bad idea in the first place.  When we stop having faith in democracy we stop having faith in the people and ourselves and necessarily cede our power to others.  \\n\\nChange my view!\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nOk there have been a lot of requests for me to pin things down better and define my view, I\\'d say it has changed a little since I first posted but here it is:\\n\\nDemocracy is any form of government concerned with the idea of giving more people say, more people equality, more people freedom. \\n\\nSo for example, the U.S. falls short of these things in many ways and at many times but at least it is founded on the premise of expanding the categories that receive citizenship.\\n\\nAt the founding of the U.S. citizenship was incredibly limited but it was still a far larger category of participants than european monarchy.\\n\\nSo Democracy is dynamic and you can have moments in the same system/government/culture that are democratic and un-democratic.  \\n\\nMy belief is the idea that the moments that best represent the will of the people are best for governance overall.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nOk so far thank you all for a some interesting debates.  This is my first time as OP on CMV so please forgive my amateurish blunders.  After some contemplation and review I have come to the conclusion that my prompt is too ambiguous, that in order to have a fruitful CMV I need to choose specifically what I am defending.

You've just arrived at the pearly gates of Biblical heaven. Everything is awesome. FUCKING awesome. As doctrinally promised, you retain more or less the physical form that you had on Earth, but obviously in its absolute peak, devoid of previous imperfections. Your mind, too, is better than it was before - much better. You can do whatever you want, in total bliss and comfort, surrounded by the creme de la creme, the best people who ever lived - not to mention your main man JC and The Big Man Upstairs. You're stoked. Eternity is going to be SWEET. \\n\\nFast-forward a thousand Earth years. You've been in Heaven a pretty long time now, but you're still having an awesome time. You've met a lot of people, but there's plenty more to meet. After all, on Earth there were around 3 billion Christians. Not all of them would have been good Christians, but even if only 1% of them did a good enough job to get into Heaven, that's still 30 million people, and surely the proportion of good Christians is more than 1%! Furthermore, since you all would have followed the Bible pretty closely, you're all going to have quite a lot in common, so you just know you're going to get on well with them. It's not just the people, of course. There's so much to enjoy in Heaven too! Anything you can imagine can be achieved, and as you're at your complete best ALL THE TIME, your imagination is working on overdrive! This is SWEET!\\n\\nNow fast-forward ten billion Earth years. Even operating at your absolute peak imagination, you ran out of original ideas for shit to do about (let's be generous here) 500,000 years after you arrived at the gates. That was 9 and a half billion years ago. You're really bored of your own mind, now. (Remember, the Bible promised you that YOU - that is, a semblance of the limited being that lived on earth and earned its way to heaven - would get to Heaven, so even in your Heavenly form, you must also be in some way limited). You get to share in the ideas of lots of other people too, though. Let's be SUPER generous here, and pretend that (even though you're all Christians, and therefore - at least to some degree - think in similar ways) each individual person has another 500,000 years worth of original material in their minds. After TEN BILLION YEARS, the thought of doing new stuff all the time isn't quite as fun as it used to be. You never get physically tired, or mentally 'drained' in the way a limited human being would on Earth. Even so, you are experiencing things similarly to how your Earthly self would have - that is, through your five senses and through your emotions (that's how the promise of Heaven is explained in the Bible, remember - as an extension of Earthly pleasures). The possible positive combinations that you can experience in these ways are starting to be exhausted. It's not quite so sweet anymore.\\n\\nNow fast forward a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion years. \\n\\nYou're still in a semblance of your Earthly form, still experiencing Heaven through a semblance of your Earthly mind. Nothing and nobody is new. Not only is it not new, but you've experienced everything so many trillions of times that pleasure, joy, and other positive emotions - no matter how Biblically epic - no longer have any meaning for you. Time means nothing. Other beings mean nothing (even God, who - according to the Bible - is so unknowable and infinite that He could never mean anything much to a human-ish mind to begin with). Again, you never physically or mentally tire in Heaven - those are clear Earthly limitations - so there is no sleep for you in a human sense. Which is a pity, because sleep would be a refuge from the only emotion you could possibly be experiencing at this time: boredom. Endless, unimaginable boredom. If only there was some way you could close your eyes and sleep forever, fade into nothingness. If only death were really real. The closest you can get to the comfort of nothingness - of death - is to float in an empty space, eyes closed, thinking of nothing. You especially try to avoid the one thought that claws at the back of your mind: the thought that, even after a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion years, you are not even 0.000000001% through your time in Heaven. You will literally be here for eternity. \\n\\nThis is the reality of the Christian afterlife as I understand it. In my view death - an infinite nothingness - would be way, way better.

To shoot another person? You won\\'t be lasting long. Other survivors will have guns. Not everyone who survives will be nice. They will kill you for what you have. And what you have may be the only things keeping you alive. You will have a gun and you will kill or you will be dead.\\n\\n2: ~~**Anti hunters~~/Vegans/Vegetarians:** You think you\\'re going to live long enough for your victory garden to grow you a food supply? Not likely mate. Hunting and eating meat will be one of the biggest necessities for survival in the entire apocalypse. Partial CMV\\'d by /u/Sierra_Echo_Foxtrot\\n\\n~~3: **Socialists/Wealth redistributers:** You think just because money is gone that Capitalism will be dead? That everybody will happily share whatever they have? Not hardly. Barter and trade (as well as outright piracy) among survivor groups will be the standard.~~ **CMV\\'d by /u/MontiBurns\\n\\n~~4: **Pacifists:** Need I really elaborate? If you won\\'t fight or kill, you will be dead in no time.~~ Unbelievably CMV\\'d by /u/jetpacksforall\\n\\n5: **Cop/Soldier haters:**: Your internet snarkiness and protest signs won\\'t be of much use to you now. However, a well trained cop or soldier will be quite the asset to have on your side.\\n\\n~~6: **Feminists:** Well, I have a feeling that you\\'ll finally actually have that rape culture you\\'re always going on about. Not that I think you\\'ll get much joy out of finally being right. Overall, I think you\\'re gonna have a bad time.~~ CMV\\'d by /u/Siiimo\\n\\n~~7: **Race baiters:** Nobody will be in the mood to be hearing the Al Sharptons or the Grand Wizard Cyclopses in the surviving world. People trying to instigate that kind of internal discord when everyone is just trying to scavenge their next meal will mysteriously not be coming back to the base camp after a hunting excursion.~~ CMV\\'d by /u/Siiimo\\n\\n8: **Intellectual snobs/Logic mongers:** If you were to question your group leader\\'s decisions and use phrases like \"strawman\" or \"fallacy of the middle\" then you are probably going to be shot in the face. Smarts and intelligence will be needed to survive, but intellectual arrogance will be a liability. \\n\\n9: **Anti-Death Penalty Advocates:**What are you going to do with that loose cannon in your group? The rapist? The food thief? The captured enemy? Your moral high ground won\\'t save you here.\\n\\n~~10: **Environmentalists:** I doubt you\\'ll be hugging many trees post apocalypse. You\\'ll be cutting them down with the rest of us for fire and shelter. You\\'ll be eating whatever endangered species crosses your path. You\\'ll either happily kill the last known Fuzzy Feathered Pipsquack Bird and stuff your coat with it\\'s feathers or you\\'ll freeze to death in the nuclear winter.~~ CMV\\'d by /u/ZanzaraEE  /u/Raintee97 \\n\\nNow I know that CMV users like to nitpick over word usage and minute details. I\\'ve done it myself. So lets avoid that particular line of attack. I don\\'t operate in pure black and white. I understand shades of grey. **I know that not ALL liberals would be useless.** I know that not 100% ALL of any of the types of people listed wouldn\\'t survive in some way. That\\'s why I used \"primarily\" in the title. I also know that some of these types will survive if they were to give up or go against their ideals. (Pick up a gun, etc.) The overall point of the CMV is that those who cling to those leftist ideals won\\'t *generally* survive long term. So I will not argue with you over semantics or word usage. (liberal, leftist, useless, etc) I think you\\'re smart enough to argue the spirit of the CMV without resorting to that cliche.\\n\\nI want someone to show me exactly how [somebody](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/008/067/COLLEGE-LIBERAL.jpg) who insists on clinging to these ideals would survive and be useful to the other survivors.\\n\\nP.S. I wish I could include atheists and bible thumpers in this list but there are plenty of both who use guns and are/were trained soldiers, so I think they would have a better than average chance, so long as they kept their annoying opinions to themselves.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Help me sort this out, would ya?\\n\\n\"Animals do not know any better, so they cannot be blamed for their actions (i.e. hunting and eating other animals)\"\\n\\nI would think one of the premises for the existence of rehabilitation efforts in prisons, for people who once felt it was okay to injure or kill other human beings, is that criminals can effectively be taught to \"know better\". Therefore, a person who believes eating meat is immoral should feel that the same rehabilitative efforts should be made for animals who hunt other animals. As they are, it is natural for them to hunt. However, it is also natural for murderers to murder when they commit their murders. We need to change what is \"natural\" for them -- reform the animals so that they no longer feel the need to prey upon others.\\n\\nOf course, aside from the fact that this sounds a bit silly, I believe it is impossible to do. This would therefore lead a person who believes eating meat is immoral to the conclusion that predatory animals need to be put down, the same way that murderers who we deem cannot be rehabilitated would be issued a death sentence. Perhaps locking up carnivorous/omnivorous animals for life-term sentences could also suffice? In any case, it would seem that severe and immediate action needs to be taken.\\n\\nThe only way I feel you can get around this is to find a successful way of reverting wild animals\\' intrinsic tendencies to hunt others. But again, I do not feel like this is a realistic possibility.\\n\\nMaybe I am just a bit tired or out of it, but I am strangely and surprisingly convinced by this line of reasoning. Thoughts?\\n\\n**EDIT:** Not that it was really coming up in discussion so far or anything, but I did want to mention that I am pescatarian, and also support vegetarianism and veganism. Just a bit of (possibly unnecessary) background on me, if anything.\\n\\n**EDIT 2:** This might be a clearer explanation of my view:\\n\\nLet\\'s just consider Person A who believes eating meat is wrong because it takes the life of another sentient being without its consent. Animals who hunt other animals take the lives of other sentient beings without their consent. Therefore, Person A believes that these predatory animals are doing something wrong. Person A should then feel that it is right for these animals to stop doing something wrong.\\n\\nThis may or may not represent my stance entirely (I am not quite sure myself), but it is at least a good summary of it.\\n\\n**Final EDIT:** I think I am fairly satisfied with how this CMV turned out. Thanks for all your replies! It was simply a strange thought that I felt would be fun to try to argue about, but the CMV yielded some interesting conversations, at least for me.

To change my view you will need to either convince me that there is a significant fundamental difference between the two, or that it’s ok to kill dogs for fun. \\n\\nAs someone who really enjoys eating meat, I would really like for my view to be changed.  I have spoken with a few people about this in the hopes that they would convince me that it’s ok to continue eating meat, but so far the arguments have been entirely unconvincing.\\n\\nI’d like to pre-emptively address some arguments that I do not find compelling.\\n\\n*1.  People need to eat to survive; therefore eating meat is morally acceptable.*\\n\\nI do not find this answer compelling because we do not have to eat *meat* to survive.  We can live perfectly healthy lives without eating any meat.  Eating meat is certainly enjoyable to many people but that is hardly a justification.  Some people enjoy killing dogs and I don’t consider that an acceptable justification.\\n\\n*2.  Eating meat is natural.  We have been doing it since we were cavemen.*\\n\\nRaping people is also natural and we have also been doing it since we were cavemen.\\n\\n*3.  We have domesticated some animals to the point where they cannot survive in nature.  If we were to not raise them for consumption, they would go extinct.*\\n\\nI am not sure that I am really opposed to the extinction of species that cannot survive in nature, but if I were, I suppose we could make a small nature preserve where 1000 cows, pigs, and chickens live.  If you are going to complain about the cost, rest assured that the cost would be far outweighed by our consumption of more efficient food.\\n\\n*4.  If the animals are raised in a humane way and slaughtered painlessly and without causing them any fear, what’s the problem?*\\n\\nI’m not 100% sure why I feel like it is wrong.  But I do know that if someone liked to adopt puppies, treat them humanely, and then execute them in a painless manner just for fun, it seems morally reprehensible to me.  Maybe someone can explain why I feel this way or convince me that it’s ok.\\n\\n*5.  Killing dogs for fun is ok because they don’t have a soul or aren’t self-aware or something like that.*\\n\\nI don’t think there is anything fundamentally different about a dog and a human that would make it ok to kill one and not the other without a pretty good reason.\\n\\n*6.  What about fish?  What about eggs?  What about spinach?  It’s alive too.  You have to draw the line somewhere.*\\n\\nThat’s true.  I’m not sure where the line should be but I do know that pigs are as smart and adorable as dogs so I don’t see why any rules of morality should extend to one and not the other.\\n\\n\\n**EDITS**\\n*7.  Animals kill other animals for food.  Is that immoral?*\\n\\nMany animals do not have a choice but to eat meat. In those cases it is not immoral for them to kill for food. In the cases of animals that are perfectly capable of subsisting without killing, I would say that they are behaving in an immoral way, but I don't blame them since they probably lack the reasoning capacity to think about this situation from the other creature's point of view.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I don\\'t think your prison should have to accommodate it.  If you wanted to keep observing that, you should have tried harder to stay out of jail.  I don\\'t have any figures on how much is spent on this, but I suspect it is not cheap.  Even if it was only slightly more expensive or even the same cost as an inmate with no religious obligations, it is an inconvenience for the prison staff, but that is only a minor issue.  \\n\\nMy biggest issue is that people in prison are there because they did something illegal and they have a debt to pay to society.  We should keep them alive and in no worse health than when they went in, but we shouldn\\'t be concerned about keeping them overly comfortable.  It is supposed to make you uncomfortable as a deterrent to doing another crime.\\n\\nI won\\'t be convinced by any argument that ignoring their religious obligations amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.  If lighting came from the sky and struck them for eating bacon or taking off their headgear then I might agree but the fact is that no harm has ever come to a person from ignoring their religious obligations.  \\n\\n\\nFurthermore, ignoring all religious obligations put all prisoners on equal grounds, which a commendable goal.

I now believe that religious obligations may be met if the inmate pays the cost difference between his needs and the needs of an inmate with no special obligations and if he/ she maintains good behavior.  The inmate may pay the cost difference from his personal fortune, his family may pay it, or he can work a job within the prison to pay the difference.  I believe that taxpayers paying for your religious obligations amounts to an unconstitutional establishment of religion, but actively blocking it amounts to preventing the free exercise of religion.  I also believe that an inmate should have to maintain good behavior to receive this or any special accommodation.  It should not be handed out across the board in hope of preventing bad behavior.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It is also uncomfortable for other people, as the person in front of me usually cannot recline their seat and has to deal with my knees in their back, and the persons next to me often have to put up with my feet in their footwell as they cannot fit anywhere else. It can also be dangerous; if I am wedged in a seat (as I often am) I am less able to move freely in case of evacuation and could also block other people in my row.\\n\\nMy height is not a disability, nor an abnormality.

I don't mind how airlines decide how to implement this; whether by visual inspection when you check in, requiring you to be measured (I wouldn't mind having my height measured to be able to fly in minimum comfort) when allocating seats, or any other method. However, I think that the desires of those who pay for extra leg room should not outweigh the need of tall people to fit in their seat and that as long as someone is over a certain height (which the airline could determine based on their knowledge of their seating arrangements) they should be offered a chance to sit somewhere with enough space for them without any extra cost.\\n\\nAt the very least, I think emergency (and even bulkhead) row seats should not be sold at an extra premium and should be reserved for tall people. If there are no tall (by the airlines definition) passengers, then they could be allocated to anyone who is lucky enough.

This includes not only current living costs but future needs such as retirement and health care. I want to minimize the amount I take from public and private assistance, freeing that money up for people who really need it.\\n\\nA disaster can happen at any time and can be incredibly expensive.

I don't have kids currently, but I might some day, and it's better to start saving as early as possible.\\n\\nBecause of this, I think the best option is to save as much as I can, letting it grow throughout my life, and then give whatever is left to charity in my will.\\n\\nFor what it's worth, I'm neither rich nor poor.

I\\'m planning on going to university for a subject about which I\\'m very excited to learn, and although it\\'ll be a lot of work, I\\'m expecting university to be a huge amount of fun as well - a whole new social life, a new setting, different activities, and most of all freedom.\\n\\nHowever, based on pretty much all descriptions of adulthood that I\\'ve read, things aren\\'t very good after that.

I agree that it\\'s a beautiful thing and that this is something to be encouraged (and I awarded a delta to somebody who allowed me to see this perspective) but remember that **the expressed purpose of the subreddit is \"For people who have an opinion on something but accept that they may be wrong or want help changing their view\"** and that what I\\'m claiming is that many people don\\'t actually hold either of those views. The argument goes that we can\\'t really determine what someone\\'s intentions *are* in the first place and so censorship of posts on these bases would be messy to say the least. I completely agree with that assessment. I still think that many people (perhaps even most) post here because they want to test their view against an educated public scrutiny and I admire that motive, but while *I do not think that is in keeping with the purpose of the sub* I also think that it somehow manages to *keep with the spirit of the sub.* I might be teetering on the brink of a large view change so please feel free to address this new edit if you so choose.\\n\\n**EDIT3:** It seems another common thread between many posts is that a lot of these OPs I speak of are really using /r/changemyview as /r/challengemyview and I agree that this isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing. I\\'d leave it to the mods to determine how that jives with the rules, function, and purpose of the subreddit, but to answer all of you at once, I think it is still slightly disingenuous (even if it produces positive results in the end) to post a view you have no intention of changing but just want to bounce around. I think something should be done about that. One person suggested renaming the sub to /r/challengemyview and, while implausible, that would be the kind of provision that would placate me. Perhaps just an explicit rule in the sidebar saying \"views can/cannot be voiced in terms of a challenge\" (the decision whether to permit or forbid left at the discretion of the mods of course) would suffice. It just seems to me that somebody who so firmly holds a view that they\\'d voice it as a challenge aren\\'t *usually* open to having it changed, but to test its strength in battle so to speak. Thoughts?\\n\\n**EDIT4:** Really happy to see the vigorous discussion going on in here. Something else I\\'ve noticed as I\\'ve read all of your posts: there seems to be an unintentional conflating of the prescriptive and the descriptive. Many of you are talking about how, in practice, this sub ends up garnering a lot of valuable intellectual dialogue due to the sometimes adversarial (\"challenging\") nature of posts. I agree that I like that too (as stated earlier) but I think that we should try shifting the focus a little bit more to the prescriptive (\"what *should* CMV be like and what is it meant to be\"). I think certain policies might have different implications on the culture/atmosphere of this sub, like removing plausibly deniable soapbox posts or, conversely, allowing them  by amending the rules to include challenges or an explicitly lax requirement on OP feedback. One person suggested including /r/offmychest on the sidebar for those who just want to vent. What do you guys think the implications might be for these policies? I\\'m not sure I really hold a side on these but my view is definitely open to being changed toward one.\\n\\n**EDIT5:** *No* this post is not ironic or a tu quoque fallacy. \\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Sports have clear winners that can be determined by either the amount of points an individual or team wins (ex: football, soccer, tennis, etc.), or which individual or team finishes first (ex: swim, track, etc.).\\n\\nTherefore, anything that cannot be determined to have a clear winner should not be considered a sport.  Even if you don\\'t accept this definition, there is a clear difference between artistic activities and athletic activities.  Athletic events require mostly physical fitness and coordination, and have a clear winner.  Artistic events, like marching band and dance, may require physical activity, but mostly utilize one\\'s creative interpretation.  Additionally, artistic events cannot be judged objectively, and artistic competitions almost always have judges who use their own subjection to determine the winners.\\n\\nNow, for some reason, there has been a strange push in the last decade or so to define just about any and all extracurricular activities as sports, especially in high schools.  When meeting someone in high school, instead of asking what that person enjoys to do, the primary question seems to be \"what sports do you play\".

When both of those occur together, you end up with a populace that hates and fears the police, rather than trusting and respecting them.\\n\\n1) Police officers have a duty to combat and possibly prevent crime.  It is literally a part of their title--on any given day, police across the nation will directly encounter every aspect of any given society's criminal elements, from petty speeding violators up through mass-murderers.  That's their job.\\n\\n2) Any given encounter must be treated as a potential worst case scenario, if the officer wants to maximize his chance at survival.  Granted, most encounters are NOT worst case scenarios, but that only magnifies the fear for cops.  It's like winning the asshole lottery--i.e., is today (and in particular, this one stop) the day that you win the asshole lottery and have to use lethal force in order to survive?  Is today the day that you could die because you didn't respond accordingly?\\n\\n3) Normal human beings have a survival instinct.

Thus, they will judge encounters based on prior policing knowledge in order to gauge threats and will react accordingly to protect their own lives.\\n\\nNow, I'm not arguing that police can (and do) abuse power.

When I'm in class at university and a fire alarm goes off (which is usually a couple of times a semester), no one takes it seriously. The professor finishes their last thought while everyone takes the time to neatly pack all of their stuff, before exiting the building, often using the main exit instead of the nearest emergency exit. Similarly, at my dorm last year they would run unannounced fire drills as often as once a month, it was so common, and the odds of fire so low, that generally people just assumed (correctly) that it wasn't real and sometimes didn't even leave their rooms. Back in high school, there were fire drill quotas, so if the school hadn't done any for a while, they would end up having like three in one week, although in fairness, in high school the teacher and administration made sure everyone followed procedure, so if there was a real fire it would not be a problem in this case, but I still feel like it helps condition people to the fact that fire alarms are false alarms. Finally, about a month ago I was at the mall, and the fire alarm starts going off, but no one reacted, everyone just went about their business as usual.\\n\\nWith these examples in mind, it just doesn't seem like anyone takes fire alarms seriously, and I think people following any of these practices during a real fire would be disastrous. I recognize that knowing what to do during a fire is crucial, and acknowledge that occasional drills are necessary, but I think that unannounced drills are counter productive. If drills were always known about ahead of time, then at least people would know an unannounced drill was something to take seriously. Also I think that drills are way too common (at least in schools and universities, in other places they seem far less common) in comparison to real fires, to the point that a fire alarm in a large public place has a 99% chance of being false.\\n\\nI also realize that in the event of a real fire, not panicking and creating chaos is probably more important than reacting as quickly as humanly possible, but I still feel like the opposite reaction is pretty bad too. The only way I see people treating a fire alarm seriously is if they can physically see fire, but in that case I think all of the training against panicking will go out the window anyways. After all, experience under non-life threatening drill situations hardly emulate life or death situations.\\n\\nI realize that all of the examples I gave were anecdotal, but it seems consistent enough over dozens of experiences that I think I can use them in an informal argument such as this.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

When you refer to a large of people entirely based on their race and they themselves do as well, it may not seem wrong. Particularly when they are given equal opportunities and equal rights as the rest of the population. However, I argue that since their identity has been linked to their race nonetheless, it in fact encourages an image of separation. When you introduce yourself, you don\\'t say \"I\\'m a Caucasian-American.\" Yet it is normal for other races to introduce themselves as \"I\\'m African-American\" or \"I\\'m Asian-American\" when we should all be saying \"I\\'m American.\" Because then if all races are indistinguishable from each other and are known by their nationality, then no subtle separation of identity happens and we can say we have realised equality on a small, social scale as well as the large, fundamental scale that we\\'ve achieved in recent decades.\\n\\nWhen I talk to a \"minority\", I don\\'t identify the colour of their skin as an important thing to take notice of when I later explain him or her to a friend.

Some of you already changed my view before this thread even hit 50 upvotes. I have a few points I need to briefly address.\\n\\nI originally started this thread because I\\'m not really wholly \"British\" in regards to ethnicity - I\\'m mixed race. Half of my family originate from Armenia in blood ([which means I\\'m half Indo-European Aryan if the official Armenia website is to be trusted] (http://www.tacentral.com/people.asp?story_no=2)) and my other half are British by blood as well (Welsh, to be specific). However, the Aryan ethnic features are not white, blonde people with blue eyes as it\\'s thought of, due to Nazism. I\\'ve been to Armenia, it\\'s not the case. \\n\\nIn recent weeks, I questioned how I should be identifying myself. Am I \"Armenian-British\"? Am I really \"Aryan-British\"? Should I identify myself as just \"Armenian\" or \"British\"? Or \"Aryan\"? Or \"Half Armenian, half British\"? Which side of my family is more relevant in determining how I see myself?\\n\\nThen I began asking myself how I would be perceived if I identified myself using any of the labels except \"British\". Would I be seen as a foreigner? Would it still be equal for me to publicly identify myself something other than my nationality or mixing that with my designated race when someone describes me? If that were the case, would people subtly view or judge me differently for it or think nothing of it? Does it depend on the person who learns this? Of course, I don\\'t hold these views now.\\n\\nThese questions I had are what led to me to take the view that it wasn\\'t still equal in that case - but I keep an open mind. So I asked you - and you definitely delivered in the \"(literal) boatloads\".\\n\\nTo those whom express a legal concern at my former proposal, you are right. For such a thing to done, thoughts and perceptions would need to be regulated, and Orwell would be livid. When I wrote this question, I intended to pose it in a theoretical light because it was only my view. I make sure I never consider my opinion as fact or a part of me. Particularly when I\\'m uncertain, similar to when I asked myself all those questions. Make you define your opinions, never make your opinions define you. To quote Tzu: \"Watch your words; they become actions.\" I recommend everyone reads [u/essentialsalts] (http://www.reddit.com/user/essentialsalts)\\'s comment for a legal perspective on this proposal.\\n\\nTo those who commented and were of different races, you provided a very relevant perspective on this proposal, and I thank you for providing your arguments and insight. It was invaluable in helping me CMV.\\n\\nThis is an informative and extraordinary discussion on the relationship between race, identity, nationality and how that influences perception within an ever increasingly tolerant society.

I understand that depression can be a terrible thing that negatively affects your life in a number of untold ways.  I also acknowledge that antidepressants can be an effective treatment.\\n\\nHowever, I think that there are too few standards from separating depression caused by imbalances in brain-chemistry, and depression stemming from real-world stressors such as personal finance, relationships, career futures, politics, and much more.\\n\\nHere are the top three arguments I hear against my position and why I don\\'t agree:\\n\\n&gt;1: People with clinical depression can\\'t just \"get over it\" or \"deal with it\".  Antidepressants save lives by finally giving people relief from the depression and anxiety that plagues them.\\n\\nImagine that you are $150k in student/credit debt.  Despite having a bachelor\\'s degree you make $30k annually, see nearly a third of that money eaten up with taxes, and nearly half of what\\'s left get\\'s spent on rent, which is increasing annually.  In the end, you barely have enough to make your minimum payments.  The cherry on top is that your boss brings home $500k annually and treats you like a peasant at work, albeit when he isn\\'t \"working from home\".\\n\\nEvery day you have to think about the future and how your current situation affects you.  You have to think about future-you.  Your prospects are bleak - some might say *depressing*.  You can\\'t just sleep it off or \"get over it\", because it\\'s not changing.  The only thing you can do is try to earn more money, pay your debts, find a job that makes you happy, etc.\\n\\nBut instead you focus on how it makes you feel:  You determine you cannot eliminate the depression on your own so you get antidepressants.\\n\\nAll you are doing is numbing the pain of the real world.  You don\\'t have a condition, but you *are* depressed.  The difference is that you are depressed for a reason, and that depression might be what you need to motivate yourself to fix your problems.  The pills just make you accept your fate rather than work for a brighter future.  In this context they are complacency pills...\\n\\n&gt;2: Doctors don\\'t get kickbacks for prescribing certain medicines.\\n\\nNo, they don\\'t.  It\\'s illegal to pay a doctor in exchange for prescribing people medications.  Instead pharmaceutical companies do what lobbyist do:  They send doctors to \"seminars\", which is just an excuse to send them somewhere exciting for a week at an all-inclusive resort all while bombarding them with marketing for the medicines they manufacture.  They don\\'t have take the company\\'s advice, buy your crazy if you think they aren\\'t influenced by the bribery.\\n\\nNot that it matters, Doctors already find it easier to prescribe \"miracle pills\" rather than look for less risky treatment options.  Though often, pills are all the only thing a patient can afford as therapy is too expensive.\\n\\n&gt;3: People depend on Antidepressants for their day-to-day lives.  You can\\'t just take that away from them or doubt the effectiveness of the drugs.  That\\'s insulting!\\n\\nThe feelings of the patients are irrelevant, as they are not doctors and they are biased.  Some people truly need antidepressants, and they shouldn\\'t be denied it.\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t mean we shouldn\\'t question the usefulness of these drugs when they are being prescribed more and more often, many times as a first choice of treatment.\\n\\nThese drugs have severe side-effects, including depression!  Why risk screwing someone up worse when they actually can get over it themselves.\\n\\n**Tl;Dr:** The standards for prescribing antidepressants don\\'t take into account whether the depression is chemical or circumstantial.  Many of the arguments against stricter regulation are appeals to emotion, not science.  Now we have a lot of people on pills that just numb the pain of the real world (which isn\\'t much different than illicit drug abuse - minus the high).  However, clinical depression does exist and some people *do* need antidepressants to function normally.  These people likely make up a minority of those prescribed antidepressants to treat depression.\\n\\nNOTE:  Yes, SSRI\\'s marketed as antidepressants can be prescribed for a variety of other problems, including medical problems that have nothing to do with the brain.  I am not taking these situations into account; only drugs prescribed to treat depression.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I was a huge fan of Josh, one of the competitors in Season 3. When he was eliminated Gordon Ramsay promised him work at his restaurants. As I thought that was a nice gesture I looked into whether or not he had ever gotten said job. As it turns out he killed himself about a week after his elimination aired. Jesus Christ. That hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I was just wanting to find out the employment status of this competitor that I liked and I found out that he killed himself! After a little more research I found out that there have actually been two other suicides tied to Gordon Ramsay's show. One was a failing New York restaurant on Kitchen Nightmares where Gordon yelled at the owner that if he didn't start improving his restaurant was going to sink to the bottom of the Hudson. After the restaurant failed the owner jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge (into the Hudson) and died. The second was a female chef on Hells Kitchen who killed herself shortly after her elimination aired.\\n\\nI tried to convince myself that this was bound to happen with the number of people that had been on his shows, but even using my most generous statistics three suicides in the past four years of his shows is about 8x what would be expected from people in that demographic.\\n\\nNow I can't watch it anymore. I can't watch someone breakdown crying and get any sense of schadenfreude from it without feeling absolutely horrible about myself. Normally I'd be of the opinion that they knew what they were getting themselves into and therefore not feel all that bad for them, but now that's completely gone. \\n\\n**Edit**: So this got bigger than I anticipated. I can't keep up with the discussion, but I'll reply to comments here and there.

I love going to church on Christmas Eve night and singing “Joy to the World” and praising the Lord for sending us our eventual savior. \\n\\nApart from religion, Christmas to me means ‘family’, and every year I get to spend time with both sides of my family.

I especially enjoy watching Christmas movies about Santa and all other Christmas movies in general. It has become a tradition for many families to watch Christmas movies each night leading up to the 25th. \\n\\nChristmas cookies and hot chocolate are also an essential part of Christmas, and I love both making and eating Christmas treats. Any holiday that promotes baked goods is a holiday I support. \\n\\nI don’t know anyone who doesn't get into the spirit of Christmas when they hear a Christmas song, and I love when radio stations only play Christmas tunes for the holiday. \\n\\nLastly, I love decorating the Christmas tree and the house with lights and ornaments and wreaths.

Parenting is an extremely hard job and parents deserve respect. \\nAnother time I was very bothered by someone not calling their parents “mom” or “dad” is when my friend was talking about something nice her mom did and addressed her by her first name in the story. Regardless of the setting, you should continue to call your parents “mom” and “dad” to show your ongoing respect for them whether you’re out of the house or out with friends.\\nI also believe that using “Mr” and “Mrs” when addressing those older than you or authority figures is an absolute must. I also know of people who prefer being addressed by just their first name because the title “Mr” or “Mrs” makes them “feel old.” They have insisted that even children as young as 5 call them by their first name.  Feeling old is fantastic in my opinion! It is also a natural part of life, but it is also something that one should be proud of. It shows that you have lived and you are wiser than I am. It shows your level of knowledge is far beyond mine and that you deserve respect from me.  Furthermore, this also creates a problem later in life when children make calling adults and respected figures with higher statuses than them a habit. It is so disrespectful and hurts those who have earned these titles that demand respect.\\n\\nNOTE: I am addressing the matter of people who prefer to have titles before their names and children who repeatedly forget to use the title or ignore the title altogether. Also, just because I think adults deserve respect for being adults DOES NOT MEAN I DO NOT RESPECT CHILDREN. I love children and hope to dedicate my life to them as a pediatric nurse. I am also 18 so I am writing this from the perspective of a child as opposed to an adult.\\n\\nNOTE #2: My title and thesis for this post was too rigid. If i could rename it, I would omit the words \"never\" and \"always.\" I understand that each individual has different preferences and respect that, but I am mainly speaking of people who prefer to be addressed with a title and who aren\\'t addressed with that title.

Thus with some planning,  I can get a degree in mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, biology, and chemistry with a minor in applied math and physics by the end of my senior year. I can do this because I already have a ton of credits and I'm currently taking 27 credits this semester and planning for 45 credits next semester. As of last semester, my gpa is 3.4 and consists of mainly mechanical and aerospace engineering classes, no bio or chem classes. So far this semester, I have had a few exams and based on how I did on those exams, I feel as if my GPA might improve to 3.5 or 3.6 (if I really really study hard) at the end of this semester.\\n\\n I am also involved in a bunch of E.C activities though no leadership roles (I doubt I would've had leadership roles this semester anyways regardless of my heavy course load). Although I am extremely busy this semester, I still find ways to make time for a small social life. I average about 4-5 hours of sleep a night during the weekdays and sometimes I will take 1-2 hour naps\\n\\nAlthough it may help a lot, my primary motivation is not to impress medical schools. I would have still done this even if medical school or other graduate schools were not in the picture. I'm doing this because I have an interest in these classes, getting a degree gives me a physical goal to work towards, and I will get personal satisfaction once I get these degrees because of the insane amount of work I will have put in. Also, in order not to seem overqualified for jobs that I will apply to in the future, I plan to only list relevant degrees on my resume not just all of them.\\n\\nPeople have tried talking me out of this but I'm still not convinced, so CMV!\\n\\n**UPDATE:** My view has been changed thanks to /u/uvvapp. He offered a perspective that I never considered and no one else brought it to light. I have copied his post below.\\n\\n&gt;Well, as long as you're sure.\\n\\n&gt;I know some people who got their jollies off of a huge courseload and multiple degrees, and never regretted it (though none went all the way to 4 degrees). A lot of business/econ/math majors felt this way. For them, the satisfaction comes from a certain pride that they could do so much more work compared to the average undergraduate. If you're sure that you'll feel lasting satisfaction, then sure.\\n\\n&gt;But a certain subset of people thought they were going to feel fulfilled after getting multiple degrees, but a while after graduation, didn't feel fulfilled, especially among engineering/pure sciences students, who often go on into further education. At the top of the engineering field, there's little pride in getting a lot of degrees. Everyone I know around here knows that if they really wanted to, they could easily have done it. To put things in perspectives, a lot of the teaching assistants learn enough to teach an entire new course's material in two weeks. To them, taking a lot of classes is like winning a small Mario Kart tournament. It's fun, and you can feel a little proud. But in the long run, nobody cares. Whereas being the first to solve a difficult research problem that the best and the brightest in the world are working on is something you can feel proud of for heck of a lot longer.\\n\\n&gt;I have an obvious bias towards graduate school and research here, so my perspective is skewed.

Most of the moms I am challenging with this post are in two-adult households.\\n* I am *not* saying that all moms should stay home with their children. If a mom justifies going back to work because she doesn\\'t really enjoy staying home, great! Go back to work, and know that you are being totally honest with the world and yourself. If you have any other reason for going back to work, other than some version of \"we can\\'t afford for me stay home,\" great! Have a great career! You are not to whom this post is addressed.\\n* I know that I am being terribly gender exclusive with my language. I fully support dads that want to stay home. In reality, though, I have never met one. Every person I have heard give the \"can\\'t afford to stay home\" line was a woman. In reality, though, my argument would be just as valid if a couple considered the dad staying home but concluded that \"we just can\\'t afford for him to stay home.\"\\n* I personally see value in a mom staying home until all the kids are in school. To me, I do not see much value for the family in her staying home after that. **BUT THIS IS TOTALLY MY OPINION AND IS IRRELEVANT TO MY ARGUMENT.** I don\\'t really care if you think moms and/or dads should stay home or not. I only care about why they believe they are not staying home.\\n\\nHere is the core of my argument. **Many women convince themselves that they really want to stay home with the kids but that their current financial realities, over which they have no real control, will not allow them to do so. **Essentially, they are convincing themselves that powers outside of their control are dictating that they must go back to work.\\n\\nI believe that, for most families who use this line, this is nonsense. There are usually options: moving to a smaller house/apartment or a cheaper town, cutting expenses (going out to eat less, cheaper vacations, consigned clothes, cord-cutting, etc.). Due to all kinds of cultural pressures, of which so many of us are largely unaware,  many families legitimately feel like they cannot go without cable TV, cook dinner for themselves each night, go on cheaper vacations, etc.\\n\\nI know that this post sounds incredibly judgmental. To be transparent (if you couldn\\'t guess already), my wife is a stay-at-home-mom (SAHM) with our 11 month son. She worked in a great career until our son was born. When she had been home for a few months (technically on maternity leave from work), people began to ask when/if she would go back. When we said that she would be staying home, we were consistently met with the same reaction: \"Oh, that\\'s *wonderful!* I *really wish* that I could stay home with my X kids, but we *just can\\'t afford* that.\" Often, the dad was making more than me! What? I started to get annoyed. I was not angry because these moms went back to work (do whatever you think is right), but that they were all giving us really crappy rationales for their decisions.  If you want to go back to work so that you can stay in your nice house, go to the Caribbean every few years, and eat at the nice restaurant in town a few times month, that\\'s cool, just say that. If, on the other hand, you went back to work because you just felt like you had to and never really considered making the kind of lifestyle (i.e. economic) changes it would require, then that\\'s really sad.\\n\\nOk, reddit, change my view!\\n\\n*One quick note: I have never done one of these before. I tried to be honest and direct with my view, given the point of this forum. I recognize that it sounds pretty snobbish and, well, mean. Please be assured that I never really talk this way when having an actual discussion about this stuff with working of SAH moms.*\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Age 22.\\n\\nBackground: \\nI am a typical Asian-American and I grew up in a traditional Asian family. My parents immigrated from Asia to give their children (me) a better future in America. Because of my parent\\'s pressure wanting me to succeed and obtain a successful job with high income so that they can retire early, i have instilled a mindset that \"time is money\". Unused time means lost of potential money.\\n\\nProblem:\\nI started having this mindset near the middle of high-school. During that time I realize why am I wasting my time playing games? Why I am wasting my time hanging out with friends? I could be spending all of this time to further develop my skills and gain new experiences. In college, that mindset has hit me even harder. I see all of these college kids socializing, having fun, \"wasting away their time\" that could have been used to study or work or to do something productive. \\n\\nAs I grew older and learned more about what\\'s available in the world, I decided that my interests and work ethics match me well for a Chief Technology Officer career. I like the science and technology side of how things work and I have done much R&amp;D research in college. I also like the business side, leadership skills, and challenges involved. Since I am already working as hard as a CTO, i thought this dream position would also fit me as well. I am considering a PhD as well since many CTOs do have it. But PhD students also work 70+ hrs a week so they can graduate on time.\\n\\nBecause I have been so heavily invested in this mindset, reality just hit me. I am incredibly tired, internally as well. I have not had any vacations in the past two years. During Christmas break, I stayed at school and worked on my projects. I worked as well during spring break. As soon as summer started, I started my internship. And as soon as my internship ended, I came back to school to continue working on my project. \\n\\nThis negative \"time is money\" mindset of mine also repelled a lot of friends. They want me to go out and have some fun, but I pessimistically reminded them that they are wasting their time having fun and could be doing something much more productive. So now I also feel quite lonely with not many friends to reach out to.\\n\\nNot only that, but my social skills are lacking and I still have not had my first girlfriend or my first kiss yet at the age of 22. (I have tried to pursue girls actually, but my mindset was, I need to get a girlfriend so I can get this over with and continue focusing on my career which let to numerous downfalls.)\\n\\nNow that I am reflecting, I have focused on my career so much that I gave up everything else in my life. It is really hard for me to swing out of this mindset that I have had for the past 7 years.\\n\\nI am starting to think CTO is not something I want to do if it means sacrificing another 10 years down the road. I want to convert my mindset to live a working 9-5 life and come back home worry free to enjoy other aspects of life that I am currently missing out on.\\n\\nI hope someone can help me. I feel so miserable right now although I\\'m not worried about my career options after I graduate.\\n\\nThanks so much! \\n\\n\\n**Update**\\nThank you everyone for helping me to clarify the problem with my current views. This is not something I can turn 180 on with a flick of a switch, but hopefully I can transition to a more balanced person because rewards and happiness can come in all types of form.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The justification for this is usually the argument that the prefix a- means \"not\" so a-theism must mean not theist. I believe this is mistaken. \\n\\nFirst, the dictionary definition: \\n-\\nDefinition of atheism: 1) the belief that there is no God. 2) disbelief in the existence of a supreme being or beings. \\n\\nRead More: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/atheism\\n-\\nThese are clearly binary statements showing \"hard\" stances of belief/disbelief, not a lack of belief. Note that these are the only two definitions on dictionary.com. Webster\\'s dictionary is much the same, using \"disbelief\" and \"doctrine\" to describe atheism. \\n\\nCompare this with \"agnostic\":\\n-\\nDefinition of agnostic: person who believes that the existence of God is unknown and unknowable or that human knowledge is limited to experience. \\n\\nRead More: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/agnostic\\n-\\n*This* is a lack of belief. The synonym study clarifies that an agnostic refrains from commitment to any religious doctrine while an atheist has a doctrine - that there is no God. \\n\\nNow some people claim that there is such thing as Gnostic and agnostic atheism. These seem to be very modern labels people use to escape the argument that atheists disbelieve in God by saying they are \"agnostic atheists\". Now these terms don\\'t seem to be recognized by any major dictionary, but from their usage it seems to mean that a Gnostic atheist faithfully states that there is no God with a sense of certainty, while an agnostic atheist says that there is no God but we don\\'t have proof? I\\'ve yet to have someone really clarify this in a way that makes sense to me. \\n\\nHere\\'s the thing: if you state that there is definitely no God on your faith alone, that isn\\'t Gnostic atheism, that is just atheism! If you say we don\\'t have proof but there is probably no God, that falls within agnosticism. If you say there is no proof but there is definitely no God, yet this somehow isn\\'t a decision of faith, i don\\'t think there is a particular word for that because you are talking out of your @$$ in a sense there. So maybe \"agnostic atheism\" is the word to use here but it is a corruption of both words in this case. \\n-\\nSome anticipated counterpoints:\\n\\n**We should let people label themselves as whatever they want.** No, because this confuses the argument and not only makes it difficult to understand what the other person is trying to say and to state things clearly yourself, it allows dishonest commentators to constantly say \"no, you haven\\'t proven me wrong because I\\'m really *this*\" ad nauseum. \\n\\n**The current definitions are too broad.** We can easily narrow them down by saying \"I am an agnostic who believes our existing knowledge makes God almost impossible, but we don\\'t have the evidence to prove the theory of God wrong\" instead of misusing words which already have a definition and causing confusion. \\n\\n**Agnostics have no doctrine so they can\\'t say that there is/isnt a God, which means there needs to be a word between \"I just don\\'t know\" and atheism.** I think this is the strongest argument as doctrine means principle or belief and isn\\'t necessarily limited to a \"yes/no\" binary dynamic. Still, it seems much clearer and more logical to say \"I\\'m agnostic but there is probably no god\" than to say \"I\\'m an agnostic atheist\" so there is no god but there is also no proof but this isn\\'t a matter of faith. Agnostic atheism seems hypocritical to me. Also see the Socratic definition below. \\n\\nEdit, one more from reading other agnostic/atheist threads: **The dictionary definition of atheist is too narrow and hardly anyone who calls themselves atheist fits it.** I don\\'t see the fact that people misunderstand the definition as a good reason in itself to change it. We should instead educate people on what these words actually mean. The reason I don\\'t think we should compromise on this point is the confusion discussed above. Plus the proposed new definitions seem contradictory. Unlike some other cases, accepting these new definitions doesn\\'t actually make conversation easier - this isn\\'t just being pedantic, it is being understandable. \\n\\nAlso, those people who do identify and use these words properly shouldn\\'t be forced to re-label themselves simply because internet goers got it wrong. It\\'s also unclear whether *most* people get the word wrong or if it\\'s just the reddit community and a few other forums. I\\'d love to see information based on academic texts or political/news discussions. \\n\\n.....\\n\\nI truly welcome anyone to correct my definitions of Gnostic and agnostic atheism. As I said, i couldnt find \"official\" definitions and I\\'ve only heard the terms used online so I\\'m basing their definitions on that context and my own limited analysis. \\n\\n*Edit: so far the definitions I wrote here haven\\'t been corrected,  but some people have added that there is a chart comparing two axes - theist/atheist and gnostic/agnostic with the intersection of each being a different word. This seems to come from the writings of Richard Dawkins originally and is also cited on some blogs.*\\n\\nOtherwise, change my views here that atheism is a \"hard\" belief/disbelief and agnosticism is the \"soft\" version, and that gnostic/agnostic atheism is a misappropriation of these words to create definitions which already exist as other words and that this is harmful to clear, honest discussion of the topic.\\n\\nEdit: as an addendum to the definition of agnosticism I posted above, please note *\"If you look at the definition of agnostic it carries a few other meanings including \"someone who carries neither of two opposing opinions on a topic\" such as \"I\\'m agnostic on cats vs dogs.\" this already fills in all the gaps between atheism and theism, which have until now been defined as opposite views.* Which is further evidence that the corruption of the word atheism is useless and confusing. The idea that \"Dawkins wrote it this way\" doesn\\'t seem a valid reason to ignore atheism being binary and agnosticism filling in the gaps, which has been clear, concise and established. \\n\\n\\nAt the moment I\\'m getting mostly down votes for a post I put a lot of thought into and have commented on every response to. Are you down voting because you disagree with me or because you think I\\'m unwilling to change my view? Also no one has so far addressed anything beyond what is the \"correct\" definition of these words today. The point that the original definition of atheist was binary has not been challenged, nor has the idea that binary is clearer. Some people have said that the definitions used on /r/atheism are the ones \"real atheists\" use but have given very little evidence of this. I\\'m open to that idea but since the dictionary, which reflects real language use, all academics I\\'ve spoken to and nearly every atheist I\\'ve met in person all use the classic definition I haven\\'t been given any reason to think it extends beyond reddit and the writings of Richard Dawkins. \\n\\nI argue back hard and ask you to give me evidence but provide that and I\\'ll happily change my view. I do acknowledge that of the major English dictionaries, Oxford does include \"lack of belief\" as part of its definition of atheism for the US and Britain , but that is also inconsistent with its definition of agnosticism in its US English section. It seems Dawkins and other modern writers may have had a pronounced effect on the  current definition in the British entries in the Oxford dictionary. The other major dictionaries do not seem to include lack of belief, only disbelief. \\n\\nEdit: My purpose here was to see if a consensus could be established either way on the definition of the word and it\\'s clearest use but my view has ended up being changed to \"Avoid such loaded words entirely, especially when discussing delicate topics like religion. \"\\n\\nMy view is also changed in that several important groups and a significant number (though not all) of individuals define themselves by the \"inclusive\" definition of atheism which is a spectrum, not binary. This type of usage really does change the definition of the word, even if it makes it less clear. \\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\n1) atheism should be officially updated to be inclusive based on widespread use and self identification with the term \\n\\n2) in discussion it is best to clarify how you\\'re using the word from the start or avoid using such charged language\\n\\n3) I still believe the inclusive definition is unclear and technically incorrect, but those drawbacks are outweighed by colloquial understanding and self-identification in most contexts. \\nBonus) I\\'m still going to call myself agnostic but you can call me atheist if you feel like it.

This is a comparison of the hardware of all the flagship phones on the market right now. This post was inspired by [this](http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/11/5797664/the-best-smartphone) post from the Verge (and no, I don't think there is an iVerge bias there). The points that they present are very valid. The iPhone 6 has the most compromise-free experience of any flagship today. It has a great camera, great specifications, great size, good battery, and a good software experience. The runner up, the 2014 Moto X, is a close contender, but it has sacrifices in the camera and the battery. What I would consider the best Android that I have used, the Nexus 5, still has questionable battery life.\\nSo, I'd like you guys to prove me wrong, or somehow change my view. (Again, this is exclusively hardware, NOT software. That's a whole 'nother debate)\\n\\nEDIT: A clarification of my viewpoint:\\n\\nMy case is that, of all the flagship phones on the market *right now* (That would be: 2014 Moto X, LG G3, HTC One M8, One Plus One, Samsung Galaxy S5, Samsung Galaxy Note 4, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus,  Sony Xperia Z2, Nokia Lumia 1520, and yes, the Nexus 5) the iPhone 6 offers the most comprehensive hardware experience. In my opinion,  it is compromise free. When someone goes to buy an iPhone 6 (assuming that they had weighed all of their options and not just gone with the hype), they would not be purchasing it in spite of some hardware compromise, i.e. battery life, screen size, camera, processor, screen quality, or another hardware point of comparison.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Yeah it Collegehumor but it clearly has a serious intention. It\\'s very short but the point I\\'m focusing on here is at 0:16.\\n\\n**DISCLAIMER**\\n\\nNow I\\'m from Europe and where I live (quite a small village) we simply don\\'t have and therefore don\\'t know most of these issues (at least not to that extend). Infact, most of us are white. Many muslims (especially Turkish) but they don\\'t stand out that much either. So it this offends you - be considerate and think about being in my shoes, with a different society. \\nBrowsing through reddit I noticed oftentimes that remarks that immediately sound racist to americans are perceived very neutrally here. We do have foreigners, being from Italian descent I\\'m a foreigner in Germany myself but I don\\'t look that much different to Germans. Yet sometimes I get asked if I run a pizza-shop just because I\\'m Italian and many Italians actually do have a restaurant or sell ice cream or something like that. That is not considerate to be racist or offensive here. But I\\'m here to hear you out, from a US perspective. \\n\\n**END OF DISCLAIMER**\\n\\nAnyway, I was surprised at some of the examples in the video. I know it\\'s the point to show people that they\\'re being racist while not even realizing it. I get it. \\n\\nBut I have a hard time seeing whats wrong about excluding a race in your sexual preference. \\nNow **if** the argument is that it\\'s racist because I\\'m actually making a difference depending on the race then why is it OK to be sexist (making a difference on gender)? \\n\\nIf the argument to that is \"Well you didn\\'t choose to like women / men but you choose to dislike a race\" then wouldn\\'t we start to ride a social-justice-rollercoaster that would continue on to other minorities, traits or features? Not OK to dislike dating Redheads? Not OK to dislike dating elderly people? Not OK to dislike dating handicapped people? Until we get to our final destination that sounds like *you just don\\'t wanna date her because she\\'s ugly! You\\'re discriminating ugly people.*\\n\\nMaybe you say it\\'s racist because such a statement would express that I think all e.g. black people share a common trait while they don\\'t necessarily have to - meaning it\\'s racist to pigeonhole an entire race. But then again, what\\'s the deal with doing so? For all that matters the term \"asian\", \"black\", \"hispanic\" is putting people into drawers already, so that\\'s racist already, no? \\n\\nAgain, I hope not to offend anyone. After all I might be just somewhat ignorant because I don\\'t live in a diverse society like the US. Maybe I\\'m missing what exactly is the taboo here. Maybe it\\'s just taboo to say it but it\\'s ok to think like that?? I don\\'t know. But doing a little research I also found this asian girl to call herself racist because she refuses to[ date guys of her own race](http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/asian-woman-dating-asian-men-jenny-an).\\n\\nI just think that IF we call this racist and put the blame here onto people not wanting to date a certain race, then we would start blaming people to be discriminating others for every aspect, watering our preferences down until we truly like everyone equally. \\n\\nNote, my point isn\\'t so much \"this isn\\'t racist\" but more the issue that resolves out of blaming people for their sexual preference, even if it comes to someone never wanting to date a certain race. \\n\\nSo I\\'m genuinely curious, this is my first post on /r/changemyview and I\\'m open for a new opinion if you could explain me:\\n\\n- Why should it be called racist to refuse to date a certain race given my arguments above\\n- If it is racist, why wouldn\\'t we end up blaming people for refusing to date gingers / elder / or just ugly people? \\nAnd finally\\n- Aren\\'t we all entitled to any of our sexual preferences without needing to justify them?\\n\\nEDIT: Sorry for my poor english, I guess pre-judgement is more fitting word than prejudice. \\n\\nEDIT2: I should point out I\\'m not refusing to date any race. I\\'m just genuinely interested in the criticism people face for doing so.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The former is something I rarely hear supported, but is at least unambiguous in its meaning (everyone has the same life quality in terms of health, wealth, education etc). Only people with a view of the world heavily slanted towards nurture believe this is possible, and most accept it is beyond the remit of government to achieve it, so far as I can tell.\\n\\nBut equality of opportunity, despite appearing to be meaningful at first glance, is actually nonsense, or at least as ambiguous as \"equality\". Does this mean starting everyone from a same footing (which would involve compensating for background and genetic discrepancies), or simply applying the same provision to everyone? \\n\\nI don\\'t view it as within the power of the state to arrange human affairs so that every child can have an equal chance of prospering at school, and even if it was possible I think the destruction of freedom and family life it would entail would be deeply wounding. On the other hand spending the same resources on every child seems equally callous: squandering talent at the top while potentially not allocating enough to the disadvantaged at the bottom. \\n\\nAs for the legal system, equality could seemingly apply to equal rules applied universally regardless of background factors (class, character etc) or attempting to compensate for those factors in the name of fairness. I think there\\'s probably elements of both approaches in our legal system, which limits equality to a principle of not being spuriously discriminatory on grounds of race, sex and so on. \\n\\nI suppose I\\'m more of a \"basic standards\" kind of guy, believing there should be a minimum amount of education, health and housing that the state should endeavour to provide, but otherwise citizens should be left to it.

It probably takes more athleticism to run a competitive marathon time or endure an MMA fight. I will say that I can\\'t immediately think of a more strategic sport than football (more on that in a bit). Though football isn\\'t the greatest in all three categories, it requires a great deal of each.\\n\\nSkill is probably the weakest of the three criteria for football, but football is unique in the number and variety of skills required to make a football team function; each position has to do things the others don\\'t. Quarterbacks have to be able to assess the movements of the other 21 players all at once and hit a small, rapidly moving target. Receivers have to catch a ball while running at full tilt with less than a second to get a visual lock. Linemen use a type of wrestling technique to clear the way for running backs (or shut down running backs/attack the quarterback in the case of the defensive line.) Kickers and punters have to kick with considerable precision over great distances. Defenders have to take down 200 pound men running full speed without committing a foul; this requires technique and precision, not just strength. I don\\'t think there are many other sports where the roles/skills of each position are as distinct. \\n\\nWhile it\\'s true that play stops and starts frequently, every second of active play is done at full intensity. There\\'s never a period reserving energy or waiting for a situation to develop or waiting for the action to come back to the other side of the field (The only time play slows down is in the late stages of the game when one team has a substantial lead). Linemen have to wrestle 300 pound men with all their might for the entire game. Offensive players have to run at full speed every play while enduring repeated physical trauma. Defenders also have to run at full speed and exert enough strength to knock down other players doing the same. I think football could almost be likened to high-intensity interval training with the added twist of getting knocked to the ground repeatedly by large men. This requires a great deal of athleticism and endurance.\\n\\nWhere football especially shines is strategy. Each play requires all 22 players on the field to carry out a very specific action. Players have to memorize a playbook with dozens to hundreds of plays and be able to execute these actions perfectly from memory. If even one or two players of the 11 on a side fails to carry out the play correctly, the play will likely fall apart. Each play is carefully selected based on a great deal of factors, including the strengths and weaknesses of the 22 players on the field, the position of the ball on the field, whether or not the clock is moving, how much time is left, the score and how many downs are remaining. But what\\'s especially unique is that coaches have to predict what the other team will do and outwit them. Football is the only sport where players spend as much time on the intellectual aspects of the game (learning strategy and studying other teams\\' strategies) as they do developing skills and conditioning their bodies. Football is an 11-on-11, three-hour chess match. No other sport has strategy that involves that level of detail.\\n\\nI invite you to change my view by demonstrating that another sport requires a great deal of all three criteria, and the sum of that sport is greater than that of American football.\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The narrative goes that once that starts to happen on a large scale, people who are not part of a small privileged minority (who own the means of production) will see a dramatic *and permanent* decrease in their quality of life. This view is probably best presented by this fantastic video [Humans Need Not Apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU). To be clear, I am not arguing against the idea that robots and computers will someday replace most/all existing jobs. I'm arguing against the idea that it will make us less well off and nobody will be able to find a job.\\n\\nI disagree mainly with this view's long term conclusions. Eliminating jobs through technology can *only* result in a society with more wealth for everyone. In my opinion, thinking that large scale automation results in a lower standard of living for most people shows an ignorance of economics and a failure to take into account all the effects automation would have in the long run. Here is my reasoning...\\n\\nFirst, let's look at how improved technology benefits an industry, and some examples of what that's looked like in the past. It's fairly easy to show that in the near term, automating away jobs in one particular industry benefits everyone else while harming the people in that industry. When refrigeration started becoming widespread, ice suppliers were soon wiped out while everyone else's quality of life increased dramatically. Yes, ice suppliers used to be a thing. Over the past 30 years, longshoremen have found themselves less and less needed, while everyone else enjoys cheaper and more reliable oversea bulk freight, resulting in cheaper... everything really. Also note that there was a lot of political outcry because of both technological improvements. People saw jobs being eliminated and talked about how the new technology will make everyone poorer. They were wrong of course.\\n\\nIn the long term, the harming of a particular industry ceases to be a problem, because the industry gets replaced by new industries with different jobs, jobs that result in better lives for people than the old industry ever did. Instead of ice suppliers, we have the jobs in other industries that the increase in efficiency of refrigeration allows: being able to refrigerate things for much cheaper and for longer caused a boom in a lot of other industries such as farming, transportation, restauranteuring, food and beverage manufacturing, etc. Not to mention the people that make and service the freezers that replaced the ice suppliers. In all, more jobs were eventually created by refrigeration than refrigeration replaced. And up to this point in human history, this is what all technology has done in the long run. Every useful invention so far has made our lives better.\\n\\nMost people who hold the view that future automation will harm most people respond along the lines that it's different this time because technology won't replace one industry, but nearly every industry. First of all, this view generalizes the negatives without generalizing the corresponding positives... namely, if nearly every industry is automated away, we will see a corresponding increase in quality and quantity of nearly all goods. And the corresponding plummet in prices. If the production of a car, from mining of raw materials, to assembly, to sales, is all automated, how much will that car cost? A lot less. Secondly and most importantly, this view looks at job elimination and assumes it's permanent. This is nonsense if history is to be our guide. In the new hypothetical world of abundant, dirt-cheap quality goods and services, most people will find some (new) way to make a living. Just because we don't know what that way is doesn't mean it won't happen.\\n\\nNote that I don't necessarily think that automation won't hurt some people or make some people poorer. I think that this will happen *in the short term*, and we ought to come up with some support system for this. But in the long term automation can only help. 10 years after that dark time, things will be looking different. 30 years after, things will be amazing.\\n\\nThough I feel strongly about this subject now I am definitely open to having my view changed. The idea that automation will hurt people in a long term way seems to be pretty widespread, but I haven't seen any convincing arguments for it that take all the effects of automation into account.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Contemporary Religions Cause Human Rights Abuses**\\n\\nAll contemporary religions instruct their followers to conduct abuses of human rights as part of their religion. Contemporary Christianity, when followed based on exact instructions, rather than its \"spirit\" (that is, general guidelines and recurring themes which are presented throughout the Holy Bible), instructs its practitioners to kill, maim, and torture anyone who happens to violate its codes. While truly literal Christians are a rarity even in the most fundamentalist circles (largely due to syncretic difficulties with the currently existing laws, and not because of a lack of motive to be even more extremist), it is extremely common among more fundamentalist Christians to engage in such things as sexual-orientation based discrimination, child abuse, and worse. Other religions, such as Islam, are just as bad, or even worse, in this respect. Some would argue that \"not all Christians are like this,\" but...\\n\\n**2. If There Is Religion, There Will Be Fundamentalists**\\n\\nAs society begins to leave its spiritual and superstitious roots behind and move on, many who are raised in, or have found, religion, leave behind fundamentalism and become more moderate or liberal. This may even extend to the point where the strict moral code of the religion is left behind, and instead, the religious belief is used for moral support or emotional uplifting. If we could just get all the fundies to follow in their footsteps, we\\'d be golden, right?...\\n\\nThe answer is no. As long as there are Christians, even in the loosest sense, there will be a few who open up their Bible and read what it has to say. Some of those people will convince their fellow Christians to become more fundamentalist. Others will simply become radicalized by themselves, becoming potential \"lone wolves.\" In any case, the further from Biblical morals their society is, the more fault they will see with it, and the more anger they will express. This anger could be expressed in highly non-productive ways, a la Eric Rudolph. \\n\\nThe only solution to this problem seems to be completely eradicating all traces of offending religions. Now, one could argue that this would bring about backlashes - definitely from the fundies, and likely from the less strict religious, and perhaps even nonreligious human rights protectors who so valiantly guard the freedom of ideology they cherish, but that is also not a total stop to this, because...\\n\\n**3. We\\'re Already On Our Way**\\n\\nThink about how much progress developed countries have made away from religion in the last few decades. We have successfully removed religion from places where it is neither needed nor wanted, such as schools, in many cases. Of course, there are exceptions - many classrooms are still religious in nature, and there will always be the religious folk who don\\'t partake in such heathenery and instead homeschool their children so they can receive the necessary dose of brainwashing, but we have made a ton of progress. Despite the protests of the angry fundies, this is not poised to slow down, stop, or reverse at any point in the remotely foreseeable future.\\n\\n**4. Does It Violate Freedom Of Expression? Not Really**\\n\\nFreedom of Expression, like all rights, has its limits. The right to speak freely doesn\\'t apply if you knowingly accuse someone of a crime they did not commit. The right to bear arms doesn\\'t apply if you are manufacturing weapons of mass destruction. And, similarly, people cannot be allowed to hold irrational views which cause damage to society.\\n\\nThink about it like this. A person who believes black people are inferior to white people can go his entire life without ever committing a hate crime. Even though he considers black people his inferior, nothing about this views compels him to ever kill, steal from, or even refuse a job to a black person. His view is irrelevant, but it might predispose him to actions, which can be dealt with separately.\\n\\nCompare this to Christianity. The Bible actually encourages its followers to commit abuses against human rights, in many different forms. Because of this, a person who sincerely believes in the Bible is compelled to perform this actions, and harm others in doing so. The fundamentalist cannot reconcile these syncretic difficulties, and he is forced to obey his religious text over the law of the land because he cannot reconcile his beliefs.\\n\\n**5. There Is No Evidence Any \"God\" Of The Contemporary Form Exists**\\n\\nAll these human rights abuses would be acceptable, even *necessary*, if it was proven that the God of the Bible (or the Qu\\'ran, or the Torah) was a real entity. However, not one shred of legitimate scientific evidence has ever been unearthed which would show the existence of such an entity. Instead, we are left with self-contradictory texts which make many untrue predictions, to the point that anyone with even a moderate degree of knowledge of both theological and proper scientific fields could not reconcile its absurdity without resorting to \"willful ignorance.\" Most believers are ignorant in the traditional sense, in that they do not even know what they are truly supposed to be believing.\\n\\n**End. Conclusion**\\n\\nContemporary religions are all irrational belief systems that are almost certainly untrue. They violate human rights by their very nature, and society would make significant progress if religion could be outlawed without unmanageable social backlash.

Wood\\'s approach with \"Cablinasian\" and other variations such as \"Eurasian\" or simply \"Multicultural\" being accepted into mainstream culture would be of a great benefit and a welcome addition to the lexicon for a society becoming more and more multicultural by the day.\\n\\nThat\\'s my stance, please change my view.\\n\\nEDIT:Removed Romney.\\n\\nEDIT #2:Been asleep for a while, so sorry I stopped responding.

Good students tend to be smart, hard-working, and conformist - three crucial traits for almost any job.  When a student excels in school, then, employers correctly infer that he\\'s likely to be a good worker.  What precisely did he study?  What did he learn how to do?  Mere details.  As long as you were a good student, employers surmise that you\\'ll quickly learn what you need to know on the job.\\n\\n\\nObviously this applies to some fields more than others.  Med school is not just signaling.  But for most degrees, especially outside of hard science, I think the signaling model is persuasive.\\n\\n**EDIT 1**\\n\\nEdit to clarify based on a question below.  The view is not that signaling is a majority factor in all degrees, but that for the majority of college students, the majority of the value of the degree is the signal it sends, not specific things they learn in class.\\n\\nWould also be really interested in responses to [this stat](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/20/only-27-percent-of-college-grads-have-a-job-related-to-their-major/) that only 27% of college graduates have jobs related to their major.\\n\\nThanks for all the replies so far by the way, has been very interesting and civil.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

For those that, god forbid, don\\'t already know:\\n\\n&gt;[A calzone (/kælˈzoʊni/, US /kælˈzoʊneɪ/, or /kælˈzoʊn/, UK /kælˈtsoʊni/; Italian: [kalˈtsoːne], \"stocking\" or \"trouser\") is an Italian filled oven bread, originating in Naples, and shaped as a folded pizza. It resembles a half-moon and is made of salted bread dough. A typical calzone is baked in an oven and stuffed with salami or ham, mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan or pecorino cheese, amalgamated with an egg.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calzone) \\n\\nCalzones have several virtues over pizza.\\n\\n1) Calzones are easy to transport cleanly. By virtue of being surrounded by dough, no sauce or toppings are going to spill during transportation, making carrying a calzone a largely risk free proposition.\\n\\n2) Calzones maintain their temperature better over distances because their encompassing crust acts as insulation for the pipping hot toppings in the center. \\n\\n3) As any New Yorker will tell you, the proper way to eat pizza is to fold it in half with each end of the crust pointing upwards, and the crust itself enveloping the toppings. Sound familiar? It should, because it\\'s a calzone!\\n\\n4) Calzones can be filled with more ingredients than a typical pizza by virtue of their design. Since they are a stuffed bread, there is little risk of excess toppings threatening the structural integrity of the calzone. With a pizza, the more you put on, the greater the risk to the integrity of the pizza, particularly when you take an individual slice. Ever had ingredients slide off the top of a pizza slice just as you were about to take a bite? Sounds like a bit of a food engineering problem. Allow me to introduce the solution: calzones. \\n\\n5) Calzones reduce wast. Calzones can be baked more readily to sizes fitting an individual portion. Personal pizzas are possible, but are rarely seen in the pizza world. Pizza is a group food, and most restaurants provide that option. To help meet individual needs, slices are offered. However, this introduces the problem of waste. If slices remain unsold, what remains of a pizza will inevitably be thrown out. This is wasteful! Calzones don\\'t have that problem. Calzone\\'s are generally made to order for the individual in a size an individual can eat. One calzone for one person. No waste!\\n\\nTo me, the answer is clear. We should become a calzone nation. Thank you Benn Wyatt for revealing the truth. \\n\\n**Edit: So far, several good points have been made, and they have come perilously close to driving me to a heresy. I am going to just round them up here in one place**:\\n\\n1) Presentation. Pizza can be presented visually in ways a calzone cannot.\\n\\n2) Preparation. Pizza can be cooked in ways that produce an ideal outcome in terms of flavor a way that calzones cannot because the toppings are directly exposed to heat.\\n\\n3) Pizza is a superior social food as it is more easily shared. \\n\\n4) Pizza can at least *approximate* some of the advantages of a calzone by folding a slice in half.  \\n\\n5) Calzones have to have more bread relative to the number of toppings (this is disputed, but if true it is certainly a point in pizza\\'s favor)\\n\\n6) Moisture buildup is a problem if you add too many moist toppings into a calzone. This prevents certain combinations in a calzone that can be put on a pizza, and is why many times sauces are delivered as a separate item in a ramekin.\\n\\n7) Calzones cool slower and less evenly, making it difficult to eat on the spot, and meaning that you will get an uneven flavor experience. \\n\\nThese are all very good points. I will have to think this over more. If I change my mind, I will start deep dishing out deltas.', 'op-title': 'CMV: I think Benn Wyatt is right that calzones are superior to Pizza in almost every way.', 'pair_ids': ['p_562', 'p_565', 'p_564', 'p_563'], 'train': 1})}),\n",

There are also a range of smaller reasons discussed at the end. \\n\\n**US Democracy**\\n\\nThe government system in place is not a good example of a democracy [\\\\(study\\\\)](https://www.princeton.edu/~mgilens/Gilens homepage materials/Gilens and Page/Gilens and Page 2014-Testing Theories 3-7-14.pdf). These articles ([1](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/princeton-experts-say-us-no-longer-democracy), [2](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/princeton-scholar-demise-of-democracy-america-tpm-interview)) explain the study more concisely. A system where the affluent elite have the greatest impact on decision making is a broken system. This fact leads to a wide range of problems including the ones described below.\\n\\n**US Military and Foreign Policy**\\n\\nThe US has carried out a large number of military invasions, relative to other developed countries. ([website](http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/interventions.html)). In just one of these invasions (Iraq War) over half a million Iraqi deaths could be attributable to the war ([study](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1001533)). Can you imagine the fallout if one other country was responsible for the deaths of half a million American citizens in the US? \\nAnd this is just one example, if arguably the biggest and most controversial. In addition, the reasons for the Iraq war are unclear to me (Oil? War on terror? Wild goose chase to find and kill Osama Bin Laden??). \\n\\n**Healthcare System**\\n\\nThis 2009 [study](http://www.pnhp.org/new_bankruptcy_study/Bankruptcy-2009.pdf) suggests that ~60% of bankruptcies in the US are from medical bills. Of that 60%, 78% had medical insurance. I don't want to live in a place where you can go bankrupt easily through no fault of your own.\\nThe US spends the most amount of money per capita on healthcare in the world, and rank quite low in comparison across a range of health metrics like life expectancy, infant mortality etc. [Dataset](http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=HEALTH_STAT)\\n\\n**Other problems** include the education system ([up there with](http://rossieronline.usc.edu/u-s-education-versus-the-world-infographic/) the most expensive in the world and nowhere near the top in performance), wealth inequality ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM)), mass shootings and gun crime ([Australia made changes, why can’t the US?](http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/07/10/australia-gun-laws)), high levels of incarceration ([second in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate)) and incarceration of innocent people ([short and shocking documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8af0QPhJ22s)). \\nI know that all countries suffer most if not all of these problems, but I believe it is to a much lesser extent, and certainly within industrialized countries in similar economic positions to the US. \\nIt just seems there is so much wrong with the United States, please CMV!\\n\\nEdit 1: A point was brought up that some of the invasions I mentioned were situations where US military action was UN sanctioned.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The only way to stop this from happening is to make bad things less profitable. Legislation is a great way to do this, but, like everything, has its caveats. As long as it is profitable for companies to influence legislation against the good of the people, it will be done.

And there are also posts from men who actually have lost half of \"their stuff\" to women in their own previous divorces. I don\\'t feel bad about this, and I kind of think most of these men are idiots and deserve it. \\n\\nThe only way a man would lose HALF of \"his stuff\" (a debatable term, I agree, but I\\'ll continue to use it here for simplicity) is if the man is earning 100% of the income in a marriage, and the woman is earning 0%. A marriage is a business partnership that is 50-50... so I can\\'t help but think that men who marry unemployed and unemployable woman are idiots. It\\'s comparable to starting a 50-50 business with my high-school buddy who is broke and has nothing to actually invest in the business... you\\'d have to be stupid to start a financial/business partnership in such circumstances. If I\\'m going to start a business with someone, I\\'d expect they contribute half, or at least close to half (eg 25% or more at the very least)... otherwise they have very little / nothing to lose, and I have more to lose than my \"fair share\".\\n\\nWomen make about 75% of what men make, no? (Correct me if I\\'m wrong.) So it shouldn\\'t be too hard to find a potential wife that is at least in the same income bracket/range as the man, correct? A man who marries a woman so far outside his income bracket is comparable to a man who invests and starts a business with a homeless bum and expects to share the losses 50-50 if things go south. Why are men marrying women (in what seems like large numbers, based on the above-linked post), who have little to no earning ability? Why are they starting 50-50 business partnerships with them? Why is it so hard to find a wife that has a job? Is the jobless rate for women that high? Or are unemployed and uneducated women simply more attractive? Are employed women not considered \"marriage material\"? WTF is going on?\\n\\nI guess in short, **I think people should marry others who earn similar to themselves - and if they do otherwise, are knowingly and consentually doing so with the understanding that they are carrying most/all of the financial risk.** They shouldn\\'t have a right to complain that they got \"finacially screwed\" when they consentually chose to be the only one to make a financial investment in their marriage.\\n\\nCan someone help me see their side of the story, because I genuinely don\\'t see it and don\\'t get it.

I do not Refute that self-built PCs are cheaper if you are looking for the best parts for the cheapest price. I also acknowledge that PCs are better for gaming. But macs have a large number of features not included with a desktop PC. Also, there is no downside (other than said above) to having a mac. **Anything you can do with a PC I can do on my mac through bootcamp.** \\n\\nBelow is a list of what the components in my mac might cost.

Not to mention that English is an insanely difficult language even for native speakers, so I\\'m not going to begrudge people for speaking it with an accent.\\n\\nWhat I do have a problem with is people who speak English fluently and with an American accent suddenly lapsing into another accent to say a specific word. This mainly arises with Latinos using identity markers (\\'latino\\', \\'chicano\\') or foods (\\'quesadilla\\'). However, most of these words have been adopted into English as true loanwords; English speakers understand them and use them often. But I often hear people on the news, e.g. a policy analyst of Latin-American extraction, using words like \"latino\" with a Spanish lilt that sounds (to me) out-of-place and exaggerated.\\n\\nSuddenly switching to another accent, at best, is confusing, as it takes the listener\\'s brain that extra millisecond to adapt to a new style of speaking. At worst, it sounds kind of pretentious and exclusionary.\\n\\nI\\'m not arguing that we should completely anglify these words -- I don\\'t want to hear someone pronounce \\'quesadilla\\' with a hard L sound, like the grandma in Napoleon Dynamite. Rather I think we should treat Spanish loanwords like we do words like \"kindergarden\" (German), \"sake\" (Japanese), or \"joie de vivre\" (French) -- try as best we can to respect the original pronunciation, but maintain our typical accent when saying them.\\n\\nDoing otherwise is just kind of disrespectful. To illustrate: I am a reasonably proficient Spanish speaker and have spent a lot of time in Spanish-speaking countries. Once I was speaking with a local (edit: in Spanish) and used the word \"iPod\", which left him scratching his head. I couldn\\'t figure out why -- I knew, in fact, that he owned one too. Then it hit me -- I was pronouncing the \\'i\\' sound like the English \"eye\", which is a confusing sound for Spanish speakers, especially when surrounded by Spanish words. Once I pronounced it as \"ee-Pod\", he immediately knew what I was talking about.

The Stratocaster has been played by greats such as Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton.  The Les Paul has been the mainstay of other great guitarists such as Slash and Zakk Wylde.  By reputation alone, either guitar would appear to be vitally important throughout the history of all forms of rock music.  However, I believe that the Stratocaster has a few important areas where it is superior.  \\n\\nThe Stratocaster is much more common in other genres of music than the Les Paul is.  Great Blues artists like Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, and Stevie Ray Vaughan all are known for playing Stratocasters.  While country music is more known for the Stratocaster\\'s sibling the Telecaster, you will see country artists like Vince Gill play a Stratocaster from time to time.\\n\\nA good guitarist can get a wide range of sounds out of either the Les Paul or the Stratocaster, but I believe the Stratocaster can offer more.  Les Paul type guitars are equipped with dual coil humbucker pickups, which combined with the weight and materials of the guitar are the reason for their iconic deep resonating sound.  To make them more versatile, most modern Les Pauls are equipped with coil tapping or coil splitting.  The result is that you can make the pickups act more like a single coil.  This eliminates the humbucking (sort of a form of noise cancellation) and sounds more strat-like.  \\n\\nHowever, it is still very far from the iconic \"honk\" you can get with a single coil Fender pickup.  Most Stratocasters come in the \"SSS\" configuration, which is three single coil pickups.  If you turn up the volume on the guitar all the way, and place the pickup selector to position 4, it uses the middle and neck pickup together, and sounds more similar to the sound you would get with a humbucker-equipped guitar than the humbucker-equipped guitars can sound like single coil.  If that is not sufficient and you vastly prefer the sound of humbuckers, Fender makes HSH and other pickup layouts to give you humbuckers.  I\\'ve never tried these, so I can\\'t really comment on them.\\n\\nAnother feature that I feel is superior in the Stratocaster is the shape of the components of the guitar.  The flat fretboard on the Les Paul has the strings a little too close together for my taste in comparison to the more roomy Stratocaster.  Also, the thinner neck makes it easier for me to wrap my thumb around if I were trying to play some chords similarly to how Jimi Hendrix would play them.  The cutaway design of the body is much easier to deal with on the Stratocaster and allows easier access to the higher frets.  The bridge is another factor for me, since the bridge on the Les Paul sticks out further, while the bridge on the Stratocaster is much lower, making it easier to move your hand around while sticking close to the body of the guitar.  That being said, I will give some points to the Les Paul for the angled head being superior, as well as the tuners being better on most Les Pauls that I\\'ve played.  That doesn\\'t negate the other concerns though.\\n\\nTo summarize, I own and play both a Stratocaster and a Les Paul.  My next guitar will probably be a PRS Custom 24 because I feel like it provides a really good middle ground and has it\\'s own unique improvements over each.  I love both guitars, but I like my Stratocaster a little bit more.

There are laws in certain places saying that when a pedestrian is waiting at a crosswalk with no signals (walk signs, traffic lights, etc.), cars must stop and let the pedestrian(s) cross. I know a friend that knows this law and doesn\\'t really wait at the crossings, assuming that cars will stop for him, given a reasonable amount of time and space. Most people will wait until the cars actually stop. If he ever gets hit by a car at such a crosswalk, it will be the driver\\'s fault. The fact that someone else didn\\'t follow the rules doesn\\'t make my friend get hit by a car any less, nor does it reduce the painfulness of the incident. He\\'s paying for it with his body, and the law will probably make the driver pay for it as well.

In the case of a phone/car/bike, you get the convenience. In the case of going to bars and hooking up with people, you get to drink, have fun, meet people, and possibly get laid. If you decide to proceed anyway, then, to you, those rewards outweigh the \"risks.\" I don\\'t see any sort of reward for saving nude photos on your phone.

In that sense, hyperrealistic works of art are vain, narcissistic, but beyond that, pointless.\\n\\nA post came across my Facebook timeline a few days ago, from Fubiz, entitled [\"Ultrarealistic Paintings by Matt Story.\"](http://www.fubiz.net/2014/09/01/matt-story-ultrarealistic-paintings/) As with most posts on hyperrealistic drawings or paintings, it got plenty of likes and ooohs and aaahs. \\n\\nI think hyperrealism is a bunch of bull however. To explain, I\\'d like to propose a couple of short thought experiment:\\n\\nA man walks in a museum and comes across three identical, photorealistic images hanging on the wall. His friend told him that one is a photograph, one is a painting, and one is a CGI rendering, but you can\\'t tell which is which. Other than knowing that the images were created using three separate methods, they look exactly alike. The man looks at the information plate on the wall below each image. \\n\\nThe image in the middle is the photograph. \"This is just a photo of some fruit in a kitchen, *I* could\\'ve taken that.\" \\n\\nThe image on the left is the CGI rendering. \"Well, I guess you can do anything on a computer these days.\" \\n\\nThe image on the right is the painting. \"Wow, I can\\'t believe someone painted this! This is a masterpiece!\" \\n\\nA museum guide comes over, looks at the information plates, and says: \"I\\'m sorry sir, someone changed these plates again. The image on the left is the photo, the middle one the painting, and the one on the right the CGI rendering.\" \\n\\nThe man responds: \"Oh, well then the left one is the masterpiece!\"\\n\\nThought experiment 2: \\n\\nTen year\\'s from now, 3D printing has advanced to the point where  creating a life-sized model of a person is as easy as taking a photograph of someone. All of a sudden, anyone can create a sculpture as realistic as any of [Duane Hanson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duane_Hanson). Some artists, however, continue making realistic sculptures the hard way, with no discernible difference in outcome.\\n\\n***\\n\\nI contend that the only difference between photography and hyperrealism is the degree of difficulty in creating the image. If sculpting technology makes realistic sculpting easier ([we\\'re a lot closer to thought experiment 2 than you might expect](http://www.3ders.org/articles/20131009-asda-is-first-uk-supermarket-to-create-3d-printed-mini-me-figures.html)) than the only difference between lifelike sculptures becomes the process of creation. This is why I find the man\\'s reaction in thought experiment 1 so absurd, and the artists in experiment 2 who go the hard way vain and narcisstic. The image should be judged on the merit of itself, not how it came to be. I could find arbitrarily difficult methods for creating the most mundane images (and a lot of hyperrealistic subject matters seems to me to be rather banal), but that doesn\\'t make those images in and of themselves more compelling.\\n\\nIf you create something which differentiates itself from another creation in no other way than having been harder to create, the whole point of that creation becomes the process. In other words, all that hyperrealistic artists seem to say is: \"hey, look at how amazing my skills are! I could\\'ve just taken a photograph to show you the same image (and I probably used a photograph to copy) but I wanted everyone to see my awesome replicating skills!\" How is this not just an act of ego-stroking vanity and narcissism?\\n\\nI read elsewhere that the point of hyperrealism is to challenge our notion of what is real, that you cannot trust your own eyes. By deceiving the viewer into believing something is \"real\" when it really isn\\'t (since it was painted/drawn/etc.) you make the viewer question the nature or reality itself. This is, of course, if the viewer can get over their amazement of the technical prowess of the artist to begin with. The thing that this purpose (if that\\'s what it is, to challenge a viewer\\'s thoughts on what\\'s real) fails to reckon with is that photography itself is not \"real.\" There\\'s a story I remember reading (can\\'t source it unfortunately) about a conversation between Picasso and a fellow train traveler who wonders why Picasso paints what he does. Picasso says \"I paint what I see.\" The man pulls out a photo from his wallet and says something to the effect of \"but that\\'s not reality. See this photograph of my wife, that\\'s real.\" To which Picasso answers: \"You\\'re wife\\'s head is 2 inches tall?\"\\n\\nThe point is, photographs are just representations of reality, not reality itself. When a shallow depth of field puts parts of the image out of focus, those areas aren\\'t, in reality, fuzzy all of a sudden, it\\'s just how the camera interprets the light. Every little decision you make with a camera (or which it makes for you) influences how the camera captures and interprets the image. A photograph is the result of a complex interaction of light and the camera. (Indeed, when the actual creation of the camera is taken into account of the making of a photograph, it turns out to be vastly more complex than painting a hyperrealistic painting. But let\\'s limit ourself to the act of the \"button-pusher.\") A photograph depicts the end result of this complex process between light and camera.\\n\\nIn fact, photography is much more successful in pretending to be real than hyperrealistic images ever could be, because people actual think photos are real! And if hyperrealism\\'s stated aim is to confound the boundaries between what\\'s real and isn\\'t by tricking the viewer, than don\\'t photoshopped images to job much more successfully? Or what about the fact that [75% of Ikea\\'s catalog is now computer generated](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3034975/75-of-ikeas-catalog-is-computer-generated-imagery)? Certainly fooled me. Is this the point of hyperrealism?\\n\\nWhat does that leave hyperrealism with then? The creational process. And really, that\\'s what gets the ooohs and aaahs, isn\\'t it? The realization that something handmade tricked you into thinking it was a photograph, and an amazement for the skills of artist. This is not to say that we cannot (or should not) be awed by an act of creation. It *is* impressive to what degree artists can create photorealistic art. It takes time, patience, and technical skill to accomplish. But the end result should be judged on its own merit, not on the extent to which it highlights the virtues of the artist. And since the end results of hyperrealistic art offers nothing beyond what a photograph could offer - other than inflating the ego of the artist - it is truly pointless.\\n\\nWould love for you to change my mind! Is there some other way I\\'m not appreciating the genre of art? Thanks!\\n\\n***\\nEdit: First off, thanks everyone for responding, it\\'s certainly given me much to think about! I found [this YouTube video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12iW6oHCw9E) with the \"father of hyperrealism\", Denis Peterson.

While they might currently be associated with douchebag bros, this is an unnecessary association which will disappear over time and as such will not be accepted as an argument against their use.\\n\\nSweaty/clammy hands: Some people are unfortunately genetically disposed to sweat more than others, and having sweaty hands makes a handshake an unpleasant encounter for both the sweaty handed person, who feels shame, and the recipient, who was expecting a dry hand. Fistbumps only result in contact with the tops of the fingers, which tend to be dry for all people, except perhaps some freaks.\\n\\nGerm exposure: The palm of the hand is used for many daily activities, such as scratching one's balls, holding onto filthy handrails, and squishing flies in a clap. Despite frequent hand washing, icky bacteria is inevitably going to end up on your hands at several points during the day. The top of your hand, however, is rarely used, and is therefore mostly free of germs and microbes that might want to transmit a cold or ebola.\\n\\nSpeed and efficiency. A fistbump establishes a sense of camaraderie and kinship in just a second, whereas a handshake can take several seconds to complete, at a greater personal investment to both parties. In a working environment where you might have to greet many people each morning, a fistbump saves time, which could be spent working on important projects, while still convincing your colleagues that you are happy to see them. \\n\\nAs a side note, a fistbump can be easily followed by a hug if more intimacy is required in the greeting, or can be followed up by a quick sideways high five. Making a fizzling or dissolving fistbump is not in my opinion acceptable, and will not be accepted in any counter arguments.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, as a conservative I would love to have my view changed on welfare. I believe we need welfare. And not because the rich ruling class wants to subdue poor people and keep them down. Everyone knows that lighting a fire under most people would get them to strive for more, but not all will, and many will fail to succeed. I believe some will commit suicide, turn to prostitution, rob, steal, riot, etc. \\n\\n\\n**Economy:**\\nAssuming every former welfare recipient finds employment, the job market would become oversaturate. This “get a job, you slacker!” mentality is simply unrealistic. Special programs and regulations would have to be in place to hire a certain percentage of unskilled worker instead of qualified workers. I have heard the current state of welfare compared to slavery, but welfare is free money to the recipient; slavery more equates to working for minimum wage with no feasible escapement. Even with minimum wage, there is a chance (possibly small) that one can work their way up or transition to a better job. As a right-leaning individual I think capitalism is a good thing. It is far from perfect, but I believe it gives many people a chance. Welfare doesn't really give anything but sustenance. Welfare can be viewed as a result of capitalism. Not everyone wants to or is able to play the capitalist’s game. They currently get our scraps. The problem is: we are getting stingy with our scraps.\\n\\n\\n**The new Laws:**\\nNow, laws have been passed requiring welfare recipients to pass drug tests to continue receiving aid. I think this is a bad idea for many reasons, including costs. However, the primary reason for me to not want to sneakily dismantle welfare is because the aid is intended to help children. No one gives a shit about the parents, and for good reason, fuck ‘em. We are trying a trickle down approach to feeding children and single mothers. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf welfare were to be rapidly dismantled, I believe the US would be in a worse state. Even holding conservative views, I believe welfare is a necessary evil. Change my view. \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Firstly, the distinction between private and public. To me, something is private when it's ownership belongs to an exclusive group of people. In this case, the group was the photo takers and whoever they shared those photos with (Apple not withstanding). When the hacker obtained the photos and released them to the public, the group was non-exclusive, now anybody who has access to a computer can view the photos, and thus the photos aren't private, they're public. Ideally, those photos should belong to the photo takers, and thus those who spread the photos are spreading ownership and making them more public, which is wrong. *I'd like to remind everyone I don't think what the hacker and those who share the images are right.* \\n\\nNow that the photos are public, it's not a matter of privacy to view the photos. I can still be mad at the NSA for breaching my privacy, however, if the NSA made my information or others public, *I could not be mad at them for solely looking at it, as long as they didn't do anything with the information.* I would still be mad at the NSA, as I am with the hacker, however, unlike my private information, you can't use the leaked pictures to hack into my bank account, or find out where I live, or find out where I go to school.\\n\\nWith that said, I'd like like to make my points a little clearer for easier view changing:\\n\\n* What the hacker and the people who spread the images do are wrong.\\n* It's perfectly ok to view the photos.\\n* You're not a hypocrite if you view those photos and dislike the NSA.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In many places this includes a cash handout. I believe this is wrong on many levels. \\n\\n* The money may be misspent. This idea is NOT based on the assumption that poor people are all stupid or drug addicts. It\\'s simply the fact that there\\'s no way of ensuring that the cash is used for its intended purpose. The best assumption you can make is that people would be so desperately craving the thing you give them extra money for that they would almost certainly spend it on that, but people may end up endure forms of squalor that were far from what the well intentioned policy makers had in mind. \\n\\n* From the government\\'s perspective, money is also being spent inefficiently. Let\\'s say a program wanted to ensure that people were well fed. They\\'d have to find a cash amount that would buy enough healthy food to feed the recipients, but people have different needs, so they\\'ll have to provide to the upper percentile of demand (the alternative is weighing people, paying women less etc.) This not only will result in discretionary income, but inequality in how much everyone gets. A food stamp system would allow everyone to get as much food as they need, and the money left over is still in the governments hands to spend on other initiatives.\\n\\n* Things like food stamps are patronising, and that\\'s a good thing. A cash handout creates a sense of entitlement beyond what something \"patronising\" like food stamps, rent vouchers etc. create. By the time money\\'s in your pocket or bank account, there\\'s several layers between you and the people providing that service. Food stamps create a meaningful difference between working poor and welfare recipients to encourage escaping the system. There\\'s also the huge benefit of less resentment of those on welfare.\\n\\n* In general they communicate purpose more clearly. Too often there\\'s an attitude of getting as much money as you can from the government, and paying as little tax as possible. It seems like people would be less likely to trick their way into receiving food stamps, education and other initiatives purpose built to meet needs. On the other side, I would think policies would allow people to see their taxes as less of a redistribution of wealth, and more as funding for benevolent programs to create a better society.\\n\\nI think as much welfare as possible should be in the form of vouchers and other purpose specific, non discretionary forms. I like food stamps, I like rent vouchers, I like free healthcare and education. Things like these over cash seem like the best way to prevent the safety net becoming a fishing net. I can\\'t think of many situations where cash is the best option, which is why I\\'m here.\\n\\nThe other aspect to this changemyview is that I\\'m ok with policies that \"patronise\" the less fortunate. Being well fed, healthy, comfortably sheltered, continually educated to eventually earn the life you want are more important than not being insulted.

It's an amazing thing, nevertheless; I respect those of you, if any of you reading this are challenged to live off of it.\\n\\nNow to my view on the MW matter, it's an artificial ideology that should only be increased or manipulated in *any* way artificially(by the fed) in cases of an extreme change of the economy or the market. It should be eradicated to the point of only increasing or decreasing based off the economy at that point in time. \\n\\nAs of now, it's the federal government stepping in and increasing the state MW. It *should* be there as a measurement of the inflation of currency and state of the market and to avoid any unfair affairs that would ensue based off a complete ridding of the MW. By increasing it, we're inflating the dollar, and thus, not **actually** paying our workers more for what they already do. \\n\\nBased off that statement alone, we can infer the offered pay of jobs what that position is worth. Flipping burgers at a McDonalds is **not** worth $11 as a lot of politicians might make it out to be. It's a job that is easily replaceable by automation. As previously stated, by increasing the wages of lower tier workers, we're not helping them. The dollar is being inflated and so is worth less. They essentially have what they already have. Just in bigger(yet proportional) numbers. \\n\\nFurthermore, our businesses will be the most affected by the increase of the MW. Having to pay more for a worker for doing the same job from before is a terrible business move. They will have to lay off more workers in order to compensate for their deficit **just** based off labor cost. \\n\\nI've left out a lot of details in the debate over MW so keep in mind, this isn't even scratching the surface. These are observations everyone can make obviously, but on an in-depth level there could be some positives to increase. Feel free to criticize my lack of in-depth knowledge on the matter.

For an act to be moral doesn't just mean that it is permissible according to ethics, but you need to actually know that it is moral.\\n\\nMost people don't understand the issue well enough to know abortion is moral. In fact, most (or at least a large proportion of) people don't know much of anything. For example, only 51% of people don't believe that global warming is caused by human activity. Only [54% of people in the US believe in evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution). 17% of registered voters believe [Obama is a Muslim](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/26/obama-muslim_n_1706522.html). Of those, a large percent probably only say that they believe in evolution or global warming because their friends do. If their friends said the opposite, then they'd probably think that the scientists were just making it up too.\\n\\nSo that's on scientific issues that are relatively clear cut. Philosophical issues are much more messy. What percentage of people (male and female) do you believe actually understand the issue and aren't just quoting whatever they've heard other people say?\\n\\nFrom the way that these discussions go, it seems to be very small. Lots of people identify viability as the point where a foetus deserves moral consideration, but they can't articulate a reason why theoretical ability of foetus to survive outside of a womb should be connected to metaphysical rights (indeed this is a weak argument philosophically).\\n\\nMany people try to construct a right of bodily autonomy, but the situations differ in the important respect that the mother knowing put themselves in a position where there was a risk of pregnancy. Because of this distinction, bodily autonomy doesn't work as a contradiction argument, only as an analogy to aid intuition.\\n\\nNow while there are strong, philosophically justified utilitarian grounds (and other more nuanced arguments within other moral frameworks), I would be surprised if more than 5% of the population could provide a logically coherent argument. To be clear, I'm sure that many of the people here can restructure these arguments to be much more logically coherent, except that isn't really the point here - the point is that most people are logically incoherent.\\n\\nObjection: Does any of this matter? If someone does something that is morally acceptable and they believe that it is morally acceptable, then aren't they in the clear?\\n\\nNot quite. Someone has to also take due diligence. Suppose someone (who believes in utilitarian ethics) is going to go back in time and kill Hitler. This will have a good result (it will save millions of lives) and they strongly believe this. But before they get a chance, they run into another timetraveller with an oracle machine that can tell them if their action is good or bad (perhaps another leader will take over who kills even more than Hitler). If they choose to put their hands in their ears and not listen to the oracle, their act to kill Hitler cannot be considered moral because they were gambling with millions of lives by changing the course of world history and ignoring evidence that might have shown it disastrous. This applies even if the result is that they save millions of lives. The point is that for an action to be moral it isn't sufficient for it to be morally acceptable and for the person to believe that it is morally acceptable, but one needs to also take an appropriate level of care when coming to that decision.\\n\\nIn the same way, human life is hugely valuable and someone who has an abortion without making a rather significant effort to ensure that they understand the issue is acting immorally, as they are not taking the appropriate level of care.\\n\\nMost people, if they were truly honest, would have to admit that they don't really understand the issue and therefore cannot be justified in having an abortion without knowing that they have solid arguments to support their position.\\n\\nChange my view.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Romantic relationship is defined as a mutual agreement of exclusivity in dating, and being referred to as together.\\n\\nThe first point I have is that in a purely practical sense, dating should be seen from a breadth first approach. It is more pragmatic to date many people and learn what your particular tastes are than to learn it by stumbling through a series of relationships that fall apart and tripping right into the next one. This is emotionally taxing.\\n\\nSecond, as teenagers have not matured enough yet to what they will be as adults. You can't really understand the significance of that intimacy at that time. One just is not ready until a later age\\n\\nThird, relationships are distracting, expensive and time consuming. High school is often what decides the course of someone's life, and it is not wise to mess with something that powerful. I have seen many people throw their lives away for their boyfriend or girlfriend, and it seems that it just is not worth the risk.\\n\\nEDIT: Please note I am only saying that people shouldn't get into serious relationships, not that dating should stop altogether.\\n\\nAnswer this and I will be convinced; Is it vital that someone gets relationship experience in high school? Would in not be bennifical to date noncommittally until after graduation?\\n\\nTo support this I point to the statistic brought up by u/tomrhod:\\n\\n&gt;The key is that the research shows that starting in the 1980s education, specifically a college degree for women, began to create a substantial divergence in marital outcomes, with the divorce rate for college-educated women dropping to about 20 percent, half the rate for non-college educated women. Even this is more complex, since the non-college educated women marry younger and are poorer than their college grad peers. These two factors, age at marriage and income level, have strong relationships to divorce rates; the older the partners and the higher the income, the more likely the couple stays married.\\n... A closer look at even these lower rates indicate that there are really two separate groups with very different rates: a woman who is over 25, has a college degree, and an independent income has only a 20 percent probability of her marriage ending in divorce; a woman who marries younger than 25, without a college degree and lacking an independent income has a 40 percent probability of her marriage ending in divorce.\\n\\nPlease, CMV\\n\\nEdit 2:\\n\\nThe multitude of stories changed my view.

To me, \"active/helpful bystander\" (henceforth known as \"active bystander\") mentality is an irresponsible teaching because it is dangerous, relieves the school of a lot of responsibility, and weakens the success rate of stopping bullying.\\n\\nBeing an active bystander is dangerous because it redirects the flow of aggression from the previous victim to the person who decided to intervene. The aggression could be anything from just hateful words being thrown to something as severe as a life-ending/crippling weapon being pointed at the new defender (not necessarily a gun, maybe a knife or something else). It forces the defender to cover both him/herself as well as the initial victim. On top of this, if there are other bystanders who choose to be harmful (harmful bystanders), now the defender has to defend against 2 or more people. This, on top of the fact that the victim may or may not be helpful in the repelling of the bully, helps to ensure that from a safety point, being an active bystander is not the best idea.\\n\\nActive bystanders also remove much of the burden from the school. When schools essentially appoint everyone as a militia against bullying, it rids itself of much of the duty to detect bullying as it happens. As I mentioned earlier, active bystanders themselves may not be powerful enough to even stop the threat. Without the cooperation of the school, overall, people will have a much weaker anti-bullying effort. If a fight actually takes place, the school can just shrug it off by enforcing zero-policy and suspend both the active bystander. This doesn\\'t even solve the problem, for a few reasons. The bully either a) didn\\'t mean what they said/did and just had their emotions get in the way, therefore feeling like they were unfairly treated, or b) don\\'t care about school or their peers and do this for whatever reason they want to.

(So I’m not referring to subs/etc. I will also allow patti melts as an exception, although I prefer them cut still).  \\n\\nMy boyfriend barely ever slices sandwiches when he cooks and when he does he tends to go with rectangular. Most likely to spite me because I can’t think of any reason to ever use that style of cutting.  \\n\\nSo my views are that sandwiches should always be sliced, and they should be sliced in a triangular fashion from corner to corner (with the above noted exceptions and specifications).  \\n\\nFirst, a sliced sandwich is always superior to one that has not been sliced. It allows you direct access to the middle, where the most flavor is. It also cuts down on the amount of crumbs created. You are also able to completely avoid eating the crust this way if you prefer.  \\n\\nSecond, the triangular slice is always superior to the rectangular slice. If you have a dipping sandwich such as grilled cheese with tomato soup, the triangular shape allows you to fit the sandwich into a container much easier since you have a smaller tip. They also fit around a bowl much easier as triangles. can also regulate how much of the sandwich you bit off easier. You can see much more of the insides of the sandwich to inspect where you might want to bite. The triangle is a stronger shape than a rectangle, so you can support the sandwich with less effort. When you eat the insides of the sandwich, the triangle leaves a much more manageable crust than the rectangular cuts. \\n\\n*EDIT*  \\n/u/Nepene gets a delta for convincing me that rectangle cut is superior in ONLY ONE WAY, when transporting in ziplock baggies.

Police in England are warning that it may be illegal to download or distribute this video.\\n\\nI don't think it's too hard to understand my view. ISIS created a video which required irreversible harm to someone in order to create. They aren't interested in making a monetary profit, they're interested in spreading their message to people. When you view the video, you're showing them that there is demand for more of this content, and they've demonstrated they're willing to kill more prisoners. The family of James Foley has gone on the record requesting that people don't view the video out of respect for James.\\n\\nChild pornography can be created for a few different reasons. A large amount of child pornography is created not for profit, but simply to exchange with others. These videos and images may require irreversible harm in their creation, and by downloading and viewing them you are creating a demand for further production of that content. I would imagine that given the choice, the victims of child pornography and their families would give the same plea that the Foley family did to avoid watching or spreading the video.\\n\\nIt's interesting to me that everyone in the r/worldnews thread thought it was completely absurd to make viewing the execution illegal, while I'm fairly sure none of them would want to legalize free child pornography. I'm not advocating that either of these things should be legal or illegal, I'm just having a hard time understanding why they occupy such a different legal space in much of the world. \\n\\nOne argument I forsee is that many people are downloading the Foley video out of a morbid curiosity, while people who download child pornography are doing so to enjoy the content. Whether or not I enjoy content is of little concern. The fact remains that if I enjoy child pornography, I would continue to view it again, and if I had the morbid curiosity to view an execution, I would likely have that same urge the next chance I got. There are also people viewing the Foley video in parts of the world which support ISIS, so I don't believe that there is nobody enjoying it.\\n\\nThanks in advance for any input! I've never posted on reddit before, and I just made this account because I didn't think anyone else was going to ask this question.\\n\\nEDIT: My view has been changed in light of the vast majority of child pornography falling under U.S. Obscenity law, while the execution video wouldn't. Although I now understand the legal difference that exists, I have a  big problem with obscenity laws themselves, but that's an issue for another day.

We see this system used in many things like in tv shows. (The Voice, for example) I think that this is a wonderful and fair system which works well when all voters have sufficient skill to judge candidates. In The Voice, the audience is adequately equipped to decide who is the best singer. People are fully capable of voting on things like their favorite ice cream, or their favorite tv show.\\n\\nThis system breaks down when the voters do not have the necessary skills or knowledge to make a proper judgement. Take for example, a boxing match. Many matches go to the judges, and most members of the audience do not have boxing experience. If the audience were allowed to vote for the winner, it would often result in the winner being chosen via a popularity contest rather than by the rules of the ring. Most people watching a match would not be able to give an accurate judgement of the match simply because their seat in the stadium or their seat in front of a tv does not permit them to reliably count the number of clean punches.\\n\\nLet's take another example, Net Neutrality. Most people probably spent 10 minutes reading an article by someone who spent 10 minutes googling the subject before writing. And now they think they know everything there is to know. The Net Neutrality documents are hundreds of pages and would take weeks to read through and analyze. Industry experience would be a requirement in making a proper decision. See the danger of letting the average person cast a vote?\\n\\nFinally, let's address the voting of political candidates. Each candidate represents an allegiance to a bundle of different policies, which represents thousands of pages of documents, which can represent years of reading and analysis. Understandably, citizens are not allowed to vote on individual policies.\\n\\nThe only alternative to an equal weight system is to weigh the votes differently. I believe that each person should have a number of votes equal to the amount of federal taxes paid for the previous year (or some variation, like average of past 3 years).\\n\\nThis would be the effects:\\n\\n1) Any attempt for the wealthy to reduce their taxes will result in destroying their own voting power. This is key and many people don't get this. The system is self correcting in that you cannot choose to not pay tax and also control the government at the same time.\\n\\n2) You would get a vote size proportional to your contribution to society. It seems rather fair that you should have a bigger say of what to do with the money if you contribute more.\\n\\n3) There is a high correlation between intelligence and income. Weighing votes this way would help to put more voting power into the hands of people who are more likely to make better decisions.\\n\\n4) We'll finally be able to have smart politicians instead of popular politicians in office. From what I've seen, the smartest politicians who can actually address issues are not popular. Any time a politician goes into specifics of why something has to be a certain way, the audience doses off. Most of America wants to be entertained with buzzwords and \\nit often results in candidates manipulating the voters into voting against their own interests.\\n\\nEDIT - There were some really good points raised which I had not though about before.

For example, many feel that the America\\'s FPTP system is to blame, as it reduces electoral competition as per Duverger\\'s law. Others feel that a more powerful criticism is that single-member districts allow legislators to engage in partisan gerrymandering, diluting the voter strength of the opposition party. Some blame draconinan Voter ID laws meant to disenfranchise certain demographic groups. \\n\\nSome blame America\\'s campaign finance system, asserting that unrestricted donations from individuals and corporations corrupts the system and makes legislators beholden to their donors and backers rather than to their constituents. Some assert that the aforementioned problems are compounded by issues in the political economy: neoliberal economic policies that allowed the rich to take a higher share of national income and wealth enabled them to game the political system in their favor. \\n\\nMoreover, many political scientists look at how governance is affected by both actors and institutions. The institutional design of the U.S. federal government necessities compromise; however, when the political parties are unwilling to work together (as is the case now), the gears of government grind to a halt. As per the conditional party government theory, when the parties are internally homogeneous and polarized, efficiency increases in the House due to positive and negative gate-keeping by the Speaker, but efficiency is worsened in the Senate due to the filibuster (unless one party has 60+ members). As a result, during periods of divided government, little gets done. Furthermore, the constitutional design of the U.S. and the system of federalism could lead to political dysfunction. \\n\\nWhile all of these are arguably problems (depending on your viewpoint), I feel that above all else, the main problem is a dangerously ill-informed populace. Most voters don\\'t have any meaningful knowledge of American history, world history, political theory (knowing about the principles upon which America is based), economics, business, science, sociology, foreign policy, etc. I\\'m not saying that it\\'s practical or expected for people to become experts in all of these fields, but they need some basic knowledge so that they can think for themselves to some degree. \\n\\nMoreover, people don\\'t spend enough time critically thinking about the various issues in politics (both issues that affect them personally and issues that affect America at large), and don\\'t adequately analyze the positions of the candidates. \\n\\nFurthermore, people are so ill-informed that they fail to even apply basic mathematics to real world issues. As a result, they fall for all sorts of hilariously misguided policies, and mathematically impossible schemes.\\n\\nThere\\'s a concept in politics called 10 words-- which is, if you can\\'t simplify a policy issue in 10 words or less, your audience won\\'t get it. Most issues are extremely complex, involving multiple sides all with gains and losses, and the majority of the audience are extremely incapable of truly grasping them. \\n\\nVoters often use heuristics to determine their vote; as a result, the are easily manipulated by pundits whom voters believe to knowledgeable. Because of low information voters, politicians have an incentive to pander the lowest common denominator, and to appeal to people\\'s fears and emotions. Consequently, voters don\\'t choose the best candidate. They chooses the candidate who promises the most and best things (regardless of whether the candidate can actually get these things done), and uses flashy vacuous feel-good psuedo-inspirational political rhetoric (compare this to Britain where candidates focus more on concrete policy and use facts and figures in their debates).\\n\\nPoliticians focus more on rhetoric appealing to pathos rather than formulating concrete policy to the nation\\'s problems. Since people are so vulnerable to manipulation, politicians can convince voters to vote against their interests, and make them genuinely believe lies including the belief that man-made climate change isn\\'t a real thing, and that cutting taxes on the very wealthy (aka job creators) will trickle down to the poorest worker. \\n\\nThe reason why politicians care more about serving special interests is because politicians would rather impose diffuse costs on voters at large while providing specific benefits to politically engaged special interest groups  RATHER than providing diffuse benefits to voters (a politically disengaged group) and providing specific costs to special interests. After all, politicians can later delude their constituents into thinking that their evisceration of energy efficiency standards actually helps voters by \"creating more jobs\" or something. \\n\\nPeople often blame SuperPACS and the Koch brothers, etc, for rigging the electoral system. But ultimately, what they are doing is airing ads, sending leaflets, disseminating their views on the internet, doing marketing campaigns, etc. It\\'s not as if the Koch brothers are literally forcing the viewers of their ads to vote for particular candidates. Voters still do have the final say in whom they vote for.\\n\\nIf people became more genuinely educated and aware about these issues, they would be able to think for themselves, and would be better able to critique the positions of political candidates and resist the propaganda spewed by pundits and candidates (and their campaigns). If people actually exercised their voting right in a meaningful manner, politicians would be less beholden to special interests and would have an incentive to pursue policies actually in line with the genuine views of their constituents. Moreover, voters would pick higher quality candidates who instead of focusing all their time trying to fundraise from special interests and deluding voters, would focus on legislating policy to deal with America\\'s genuine issues (climate change, education, etc). \\n\\n**EDIT: Thanks for the excellent comments everyone!

However, there\\'s a few points I feel weren\\'t made there. I\\'ll try to avoid treading over the same ground.\\n\\nFor one, my idea of an \"urban\" area is one where most amenities are in range of walking, biking, or a relatively short bus ride. This includes schools, shops, parks, etc. This was brought up in the past AMA, but the discussion didn\\'t really include a comparison of accessibility. Cities can generally be navigated without a car because they usually preceded the car. Suburbs, on the other hand, were designed explicitly around cars: the feasibility of walking wasn\\'t taken into consideration by planners, developers, or business owners when placing public spaces and private businesses.\\n\\nThis critical distinction means that while suburbs may have shops, parks, libraries, and of course schools, children are completely dependent on their parents for access. This is not conducive to raising kids with an independent mindset. Where the urban 10-year old who wants to play soccer, see his friends or buy an ice-cream cone can simply get up and go, the suburban kid has to ask her parents, who then have to agree to take time out of their day to drive her down. Furthermore, the urban kid would get passive exercise if he walked or biked to where he was going; the suburban kid rarely has that option for reasons of distance or safety. \\n\\nWhen she turns 16, the suburban kid does have the option of getting a car. However, this means thousands of dollars have to be dedicated to getting the independence and freedom that the urban kid has already had for years. The urban 16-year-old is more likely to spend money from a job on something other than basic transportation.\\n\\nThese criticisms also all apply to rural areas, but those have one critical offset: access to space. My childhood was spent between rural western Washington state and rural eastern Oregon. In both cases, though my neighborhoods might have resembled suburbs, there was a lot of undeveloped, unfenced land around. My friends might have had to be dropped off by their parents, but once they were there, we went exploring in the woods or desert, built forts, rode bikes, played war. When I got older, we could play paintball. Other kids in the neighborhood rode dirt bikes. Though we didn\\'t have access to ball fields or libraries in walking distance, we did have the forest (W Washington) or desert (E Oregon) as a playground. Other rural kids that I have known have learned to build small structures, raised livestock, or learned target shooting.\\n\\nIn short, the design of the suburbs makes it almost impossible to get around without a car. This prevents children who grow up there from developing independent problem-solving abilities that their urban and rural peers will develop. They will be less likely to exercise, because more barriers are thrown into their way. When they get to driving age, they will most likely take a part-time job and dedicate most of its proceeds to getting the mobility their urban peers take for granted. Parents who choose a house in the suburbs over a house within city limits are saddling their children with dependence, inactivity, and expense. Please CMV.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

His actions must done alongside of some kind of self interest. Shoot an innocent person who poses no danger in the head execution style in public? Really?

Also, I am referring to accepting money for scholarships, not scholarships that were established in the past and are simply continuing to run on investments.\\nPrior to the past 30 or so years, there was a massive gender gap in university. This gap was due to stigma against women and the status quo that existed at that time. Scholarships were very important to encourage females to attend university. Likewise, racial minorities were greatly misrepresented. However, I believe that now they are not only not needed, but they provide an unfair bias towards specific people.\\nIn recent surveys in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia, there is an relatively equal ratio of male to female at universities, with the average usually leaning towards 45-55 male to female. In addition, the increase in female intake results in an even bigger increase in the gap. Now, there is still a gap between male and females in physical sciences, maths, and engineering, ranging between relatively small (60:40 male:female), to quite large (85:15). While this may be an issue, I do not believe scholarships are a way to solve it, as they have been continuously offered, and yet the gap is increasing still in some cases. I believe that the way to solve it would be for a greater push for opportunities in high school perhaps.\\nSimilarly, race is nowhere near the issue it was in the past. Virtually all major universities are quite culturally diverse, and wish to take in the best students, regardless of race. In addition, due to immigration in the past, there are students who can gain major scholarships despite being quite removed from their \"racial background\" (as an example, I knew someone who got a major scholarship for being of Korean descent, despite the fact that his parents left when they were young and he had never visited).\\nAll in all, I believe it is discrimination that someone is restricted from certain financial aid for the sole reason of their birth. Receiving a scholarship no longer is due to being very good at what you do compared to everyone, but rather only compared to people of a specific small group. Now, it is possible that people of certain areas may have received less education or support, but I believe aid for those people should be  given based upon circumstance rather than gender or race. In addition, such scholarships lead to confusion regarding certain parties: for example, is a intersex or a transgender person male or female? In the end, I believe that such scholarships should be offered to everyone, with equal opportunities.\\n\\n**edit: This blew up way more than I wished, and it was unfortunate that some emergency stuff came up which could not be avoided. I shall answer some individual comments shortly, but in the meantime here is my standpoint.**\\n\\n**Changed views**\\n\\n* Realistic implementation: As people have pointed out to me, it is much harder to implement such a view without marginalizing minorities than I thought. I concede that though I may disagree with it on principle, it is still near impossible to change in the near future.\\n\\n* Imbalance in some locations: Some people have pointed out that I have made some major assumptions, and that there is still major racism and sexism in many locations. Perhaps as a non-American in a very culturally diverse location, I have a much different experience than most of Reddit; I go to school where whites are the minority, and work at a university that is 90% Indian and Asian. I tried to do as much research as possible, but obviously personal experience in this case is something I don\\'t have.\\n\\n**Maintained views**\\n\\n* Ideological belief: This is something that I feel has perhaps been reaffirmed by the constant statement that \"It might work in theory, but never in practice\". I still hold the belief that in a vacuum, scholarships should be merit based, and that they should be available for people of all race and sex.\\n\\n* Belief that certain issues are better addressed through other means: People have brought up that white males have an advantage in terms of opportunities that exceeds the few scholarships of race. Where I live I have never experienced that (in fact, in general, the white population is actually poorer than many other races). However, assuming in such a case, I believe that aid should be given based upon economic situations rather than race. There can very well be white males in poor circumstances with limited education, just like there can for anyone else.\\n\\n* Money should not be donated to a sexist/racist cause: Not saying that this is one, but some people have made the point that \"people should be able to do whatever they want with it\". I disagree still, and believe that it should not be allowed to support hateful causes.\\n\\n**Notes**\\n\\n* First and foremost, as mentioned above, I am not American, and this has led to some confusion on both parties. Laws seem to be different in the States than where I live (we are not allowed to give money to racist, sexist, or hateful things). Similarly, we do not have legacy or athletic scholarships, and you can\\'t get into university simply because you are rich. Some people have brought up that it is unfair to ban affirmative action and allow these scholarships. If it was my decision, I would ban those as well, and make scholarships completely need based or merit based, independent of anything else. \\n\\n* I am aware that the amount of scholarships available to people of race only is minimal; this is more about the concept and belief, rather than actual financial aid given out. In my experience, it is not rare to have 1/4 major scholarships available only to people of race where I live, but like I said, it may be different elsewhere.\\n\\n* **Most importantly, I hope I am not coming across as racist or sexist. Often when these discussions come up, people seem to take a very polarized opinion. While I do not agree with some views, I can understand almost all of them. Personally, I am someone who believes in equal opportunities for people of all races, classes, and sexes.**\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This post is solely to look at the decision to release the CCTV footage of Michael Brown robbing a convenience store.\\n\\nNow that that\\'s out of the way, I don\\'t really understand why everyone was so angry at the release of the CCTV footage showing what appears to be Michael Brown robbing a convenience store. I see in multiple news sources where people have stated that the footage \"\\'appeared to cast aspersions\\' on the dead man\" or is a form of character assassination.* \\n\\n*http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-28827304\\n\\nFinding out that the shooting victim had just returned from robbing a store is critical information, because it provides context for the fact that a police officer confronted him (over something minor and unrelated like obstructing the street) and a violent altercation took place soon after. I see family members and other people saying that he wasn\\'t \"perfect,\" but it seems to me that they\\'re dismissing the fact that he had just committed a crime.* The police officer may not have known of Michael Brown\\'s actions, but it makes sense that Michael Brown would be more on-edge, scared, and impulsive after committing a crime and encountering a police officer so soon after. Thus, this footage provides a critical perspective into Michael Brown\\'s state of mind and his subsequent mannerisms/behavior might have alerted Officer Wilson and escalated the encounter.\\n\\n*http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-fergsuon-shooting-police-name-20140815-story.html#page=1\\n\\nMy view is that the CCTV footage was essential information that needed to be provided to the public. While it may have been misconstrued as character assassination, the footage is an invaluable part of the story that helps explain the context and actions of both Officer Wilson and Michael Brown. \\n\\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments! I really appreciate it.

Additionally, the footage should have been released alongside other information which was excluded, providing a lop-sided view of the situation which served to inflame tensions rather than using information to allay them.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, stranger!\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I am specifically arguing this from a perspective of US law.\\n\\nThere are various things that disqualify people from being allowed to purchase or possess firearms or ammunition. These generally include (sometimes depending on state) being involuntarily committed to a mental institution, being the target of a restraining order, being adjudicated by a court to be mentally unfit to stand trial, being convicted of a violent misdemeanor or a domestic violence crime, and being convicted of a felony.\\n\\nMost people seem to be perfectly happy with prohibiting some people from possessing firearms based on their history, convictions, mental illness, etc. I believe we should be very careful with who we remove constitutionally protected rights from, but I am ok with removing firearm rights through due process of law in most of the cases where we do under current law.\\n\\nMy question is why do we not remove the privilege of people to possess and consume alcohol under certain circumstances? This isn't a constitutionally protected right, and removal of that freedom would be done with due process anyway, so there is no particular reason why we cannot do it.\\n\\nWe should create a list of offenses that disqualify a person from being allowed to possess or consume alcohol. That list should include people with a DUI conviction that resulted in injury or death to an innocent person, with a felony DUI conviction (multiple DUIs in a short period, DUI while on a suspended license, etc), people with a domestic violence or child endangerment conviction that was alcohol related, and perhaps even people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution with suicidal tendencies.\\n\\nAlcohol consumption seems to increase risk of suicide in people who are already very depressed or suicidal, it seems to increase the likelihood of domestic violence and child abuse, and it definitely increases the risk of DUI in people with prior DUI convictions.\\n\\nIn fact, I have a friend with 4 DUIs over a period of less than 10 years, 1 while driving on a suspended license, and yet they still eventually gave him his license back, and he still drinks regularly and sometimes drives while under the influence. I think that is appalling, just because he hasn't hurt anyone yet doesn't mean he should be allowed to keep drinking and driving until someone gets killed. His ability to legally possess and consume alcohol is a danger to society, and simply suspending his license again isn't good enough, he will still drive illegally even without a license.\\nHere is how I would implement it. I think it is too much of a burden to require all bars and liquor stores to call up a system and run a background check on every patron like the current NICS system for firearms. Instead, I propose that people who are deemed to be prohibited persons should have a special mark placed on their driver's license or ID which would indicate that they are prohibited. Bar tenders and liquor store employees would need to check everyone's ID, not just people who appear to be under age, and would be required to refuse to sell alcohol to anyone with that mark on their license.\\n\\nObviously that won't stop them from paying a homeless person to buy them alcohol, like teenagers do, so we also need strict penalties for prohibited persons who are caught with any alcohol in their blood or in their possession, and even stricter penalties if they are caught committing any sort of crime while under the influence such as DUI, domestic violence, etc.\\n\\nThis post was prompted by this thread, but has also been something I've been thinking about for a long time:http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2dnxcy/should_the_government_be_allowed_to_ban_people/\\n\\nTL;DR: Just like some people are deemed by society to be too irresponsible to be allowed to possess firearms due to criminal activity or mental illness, some people (potentially for different reasons) should be deemed by society to be too irresponsible to be allowed to possess or consume alcohol, and it should be a criminal offense for a prohibited person to possess or consume alcohol.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I am completely pro choice but I don't like the way discussion in some cases takes place. For example, I saw a post on two x that didn't really refute any restrictive abortion policies but just stated the right to bodily autonomy as an argument against them. I don't feel like stating that is a proper refutation. I think that if we were to look at something like sex selective abortion policies it might be more obvious what I see is wrong with those arguments. Imagine if they were having a debate in India. One person brings up all this data about the problems with unrestricted sex selective abortion and the other person simply said that those policies shouldn't be allowed because it was their right to an abortion for whatever reason they wish. This would be bad because the discussion is far too nuanced.\\n\\nI think that there are problems that arise from hiding behind this argument. The fundamental reason I would consider it bad is this. Rights are a human construct. A bunch of people got together and decided that guaranteeing certain rights would be best for the people. It seems perfectly reasonable that they could've been wrong and that guaranteeing those rights in certain situation are bad. Not trying to suggest whether or not they are. They could be though so arguing that something shouldn't happen because it is your right is a terrible argument.\\n\\nI'm not trying to suggest all discussion that takes place is like this. When talking about gun rights there is a lot of fruitful and important discussion using data, statistics, and other relevant factors. However, there is a small group of arguers who would refute arguments from the other side by simply saying that it is their right guaranteed by the second amendment.\\n\\nI think that rights are not relevant in policy discussion.\\n\\nEdit: My view has been changed thanks to iamblegion.

From what I\\'ve read, forcible rape victims often find the experience highly traumatic and suffer long-term psychological problems. Virtually all would agree that the experience was a huge negative. But I think, if you were to poll a group of statutory rape victims years later when they were more mature, you would get a much more diverse range of responses.

Covering yourself in penises, being out-of-the-norm for the sake of being out of the norm, and basically acting as freakish as possible could give otherwise on-the-fence people a bad impression.

But acting in this manner simplifies the issue, and allows people to assign x to y, taking a lot of gravity and maturity away from any moving forward.\\n\\nOn another note, if this is legitimately your personality, I don\\'t think you should have to conform.

Instead, I simply don’t believe that automation will take off on the widespread scale that some people are speculating. In this Youtube video [Humans Need Not Apply]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) the narrator believes that all jobs, not just simple manufacturing jobs, will be replaced by robots. He relates our perils to that of the early 20th century horse that was replaced by the automobile. But I think this comparison is crude and does not take into the account of economics. \\n\\nLet’s say his vision comes to fruition and the people with unskilled jobs are given the boot. And for the sake of generalization, let’s also assume that the number of people receiving minimum wage is roughly similar to the number of unskilled laborers in the US (if you don’t agree with this generalization I apologize). According the 2011 study from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, [73.9 million people]( http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2011.htm) work for minimum wage salary which represents almost 3/5 the number of salaried workers in the US. So back to the matter at hand. Let’s say that they are let go from their jobs due to the fact that automation would be cheaper for business owners. We now have roughly 74 million people out of jobs. Yup, I’d say that would put us in the very least a recession, or possibly a depression. These 74 million people would be unable to acquire the skills necessary to be hirable in the dwindling workforce due to a lack of money to receive an education.\\n\\nSo now let’s assume that these 74 million people without jobs will go into a super saving mode in order to be able to buy food and keep whatever shelter they have over their heads. I don’t think the government will be able to provide substantial welfare to almost half of the work force. According to [Labor Market Information]( http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/laus/us/usadj.htm) the workforce in August of 2011 was 153,724 Americans and the workforce in July of 2014 was 156,023 people. Pretty similar numbers, so let’s stick with 2011 since that’s the date of the BLS study. If we add the current unemployed with the newly unemployed due to automation and divide that number by the labor force (73.9+13.8)/153.72 we would get an unemployment rate of 57%. Yikes I doubt the economy is doing great right now with almost 60% of the population unemployed. Even if the robots are cheaper and banging out products day in and day out, who is going to buy the merchandise? The United States GDP would be in crumbles! Businesses would go out of business due to a lack of cash flow and even more people would be unemployed. It would be a nasty cycle that would keep pushing more and more people out of jobs and onto the streets.\\n\\nNow, I think that the only way this level of automation would work is if our society converted into completely socialist society and shared the wealth and products of the robots equally. But I simply don’t see that happening. It would be possibly the largest undertaking by the Government ever to create a working and efficient socialist system based purely on handouts. Plus I can’t ever see the government allowing automation to take away the jobs of so many Americans. When Tesla began to put pressure on regular auto dealers because of their superior product, New Jersey, Texas, Colorado, Arizona, and Virginia all prohibited the sale of Tesla’s in their states. If those states will go to those measures to protect car dealers, I would bet money that the Federal Government would do a good deal to protect the jobs of 60% of the workforce.\\n\\nI simply don’t think that automation will change our lives as radically as the folks at /r/futurology would like you to believe. Sure, automation will come into effect in the future, but I don’t think that it will be the problem that some have been making it out to be. So, if you do believe this is a bigger issue than I do, please CMV.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The more awareness for what it is, the better.\\n\\nI have a few viewpoints on this subject that I would like to get out there because it\\'s been bothering me.\\n\\nLittle background: I\\'ve never been clinically diagnosed (I\\'ll get to why later), but for the first 2 years of college, something weird happened. I went from having great grades in high school and a lot of friends, to finding myself literally holing up in my dorm room every night and every weekend. I gained roughly 50 pounds over those 2 years, and I was failing all my classes. I wasn\\'t even able to muster the effort to put the work in. Also, I distinctly remember having suicidal thoughts. I never actually thought I would go through with any of them, but it occupied my mind quite a bit. \\n\\nI wanted to change. I desperately tried. But nothing was clicking. I definitely read a little bit into depression during this time, and I figured that I had some minor variant of it. I wanted to reach out and talk to someone but I figured that I could handle it on my own. I read a lot into depression and overcoming it, and I knew that exercise and a better diet would help but I still wasn\\'t able to do any of that. Like I couldn\\'t get myself to do what I know I needed to do. It pissed me off. I blamed myself for that, and I still do. \\n\\nSo here\\'s where it gets interesting, and here\\'s where I hope some of you can shed light on this topic. This was almost 3-4 years ago so I\\'m forgetting exactly where the shift happened, but the summer after my 2nd year I started reading a lot into Zen Buddhism and Stoicism and this COMPLETELY changed my view on the world and my life. What I realized was that my thoughts are in my head (obviously), and that I can be in control of them. I realized that I was putting positives and negatives into certain situations, when the situation is neutral by default. The big thing for me was realizing that the world isn\\'t mean or nice, it\\'s indifferent. It literally gives no fucking shits about any of us. So I think what happened to me was that I had an expectation of reality that was different from reality itself. I believe this caused my 2 year downward spiral to a point where I was an utter failure, friendless, and alone. \\n\\nThis was definitely a ramble but I hope it made some sense. I\\'m at a point in my life now where I\\'m having a hard time remembering EXACTLY how I felt during that period, but I definitely remember that I would sometimes cry in the shower and do other things of that nature. I was literally alone for 720 days straight. I would just wake up and sit in my room the entire day. I would ask for extensions and still not be able to muster up any assignments.\\n\\nAt the time I saw that as a character flaw, and now I still see it as a character flaw. So does this mean that I see depression as a character flaw? I also learned that a lot of people go through similar bouts. Maybe not quite as intense (rarely quite so intense...to the point where it is affecting your future), but definitely something noticeable. So if I can get through it with reading books and changing my mental attitude, why can\\'t everyone else? Why can\\'t we all realize that life isn\\'t fun and games, that it\\'s indifferent. Our thoughts CAN be controlled. I couldn\\'t control them before, but now I can. It\\'s not an overnight process; it took me about 3 years to go from that fateful summer of meditation and Stoicism to where I am now. I\\'m at a point now where I can objectively evaluate the things that are going on in my life, and even if they\\'re \"bad\", I can handle it.\\n\\nSo instead of popping pills and getting electric therapy, why don\\'t we medicate people with depression with books and meditation and a MENTAL SHIFT, instead of a chemically-induced whatever-a-pill-is?\\n\\nBTW, this same thing applies to anxiety. I went from having crippling anxiety to...still having crippling anxiety, but it\\'s gotten better. I went from not being able to hold a conversation without panicking, sweating, almost crying, to being able to hold conversations for as long as necessary. Again, this all happened without meds. This happened with a mental shift that I induced through books and meditation.\\n\\nI guess I\\'m wondering if someone can explain to me why the go-to method is popping pills and therapy, when I know for a fact that you can bootstrap your own healing? I\\'m not saying to man up or buck up, I\\'m saying to realize that \"it\\'s all in your head\" and that you don\\'t have to be a slave to it. Meditation and self-help books helped me with that a lot.\\n\\nTL;DR: Pills are unnecessary for depression and anxiety. They\\'re just character flaws that can be changed with practice. Obviously this doesn\\'t apply to the fringe cases (like Robin Williams or others who commit suicide) but definitely applies to the majority of people who claim they\\'re depressed or anxious.', 'op-title': 'CMV: For the majority of cases, depression can be treated without medication.', 'pair_ids': ['p_723'], 'train': 1})}),\n",

I understand the arguments that the operating systems run more efficiently and that apple is supposed to have better customer service and warranties but do they? Isn't Apple more just forcing you to buy an extended warranty with your product. \\n\\nThe old people comment comes from being in the teaching profession and observing that for the same price, teenagers today prefer similarly priced Android phones to Iphones. Does this mean that Apple is holding onto their market share because of old ideas of their supremacy in the smart phone market maintained by older people? I don't know maybe.\\n\\nI'll give you some of my background with computers and phones. I grew up using Apple products. My parents always had apple's (or macintoshes) when I was a kid. We had a windows and an IMAC, I felt that for the price the Apple products were not worth it especially considering the limited upgradablity, which is only used by Apple to make more money. I have always bought windows computers since. I play games on my computer still but rarely ever a game that is very demanding in terms of graphics and processing. \\n\\nI have used both Android phones and Iphones and in my experience the two offer a similar quality. I prefer that android is far more customization that the Iphone so I use that but my current phone HTC-One M8 cost the same price as an Iphone. Although, I would argue that Apple's refusal to allow a microSD slot makes it a little overpriced still.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Darth Vader is also guilty of this, routinely killing Imperial officers. So does the Joker in the Dark Knight, and this actually almost goes wrong for him. \\n\\nAll three of these examples represent slightly different reasons for killing your henchmen, but I think each one is poor form. In the case of the Ninja Turtles villain, actions like that engender dissent and create a culture of fear and paranoia among your henchmen. I mean those guys just had to hold down their coworker and watch him die, how do they know it\\'s not going to be them next time? If anything would inspire me to quit or revolt, that would definitely be up there.\\n\\nIn the case of Darth Vader, he kills Imperial officers for failing him, which stifles creativity and likely costs him a lot of high quality officers. The Empire is fighting an insurgency and as recent events in Afghanistan showed, mistakes are going to be made, and it\\'s difficult work. I suspect that the reason Vader is constantly saddled with incompetent officers is that he killed all the competent ones long ago and now no one wants to work with him. Also the Empire clearly doesn\\'t promote based on merit, because Vader immediately promotes a guy after the first time we see him kill someone, and that guy sucked just as much.\\n\\nIn the case of the Joker, his plan almost backfires as it\\'s happening. You think when the Joker gets back to his Joker-Cave none of his countless other henchmen are going to be like \"Hey, where\\'s Vinny and Don and Jake? Didn\\'t they go to rob that bank with you?\" The Joker treats all of his henchmen as completely disposable and useless, which is likely how he sees them, but that\\'s bad for morale. It\\'s not like there\\'s a shortage of villains hiring random thugs for stuff in Gotham. Go seek a job where your employer isn\\'t a constant source of danger.\\n\\nMachiavelli said that if you can\\'t be loved and feared, it\\'s better to be feared, but he touted Cesare Borgia as a great leader, and that guy died naked and alone of a stab wound. The only case where I think killing your henchmen makes sense is shooting deserters in the middle of a pitched battle, as that encourages continued fighting in the moment over desertion in an \"over the top\" kinda situation. Otherwise it\\'s bad for business and lowers morale. There are better ways to handle all these situations.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I just found this sub-reddit tonight as I was thinking about a lot of opinion topics so I thought it would be a good time to express this opinion of mine. Disclaimer: I'm neither a vegan nor a vegetarian.\\n\\nI understand that many vegetarians abstain from meat because they feel morally guilty or they feel that it is wrong to kill animals for food. I suppose that some vegetarians may just not want to take part in eating meat themselves and don't really care about the bigger picture but that seems like a shallow and pointless reason to be a vegetarian to me. While meat-eaters don't actively kill the animals themselves by eating them, they support the slaughterhouses and farms that do kill the animals for food production by continuing to consume meat. If meat is demanded it will be supplied, and vegetarians aim to reduce the demand. This to me seems like a much more legitimate purpose and reasoning for being vegetarian. This same philosophy compels people to vote in democratic governments. Even if they are only one person, it takes many individuals to come together to elect representatives. This is the most valid argument that I can think of in favor of moral vegetarianism.\\n\\nThis philosophy is all fine and good but vegetarians alone will not and cannot fulfill this goal by virtue of not being vegans. As long as dairy products and eggs are consumed, there is still a need for dairy cows and egg-laying chickens. When the cows no longer produce milk and the chickens no longer lay eggs what do you think happens to them? Generally they are turned into meat for human consumption. Vegetarians drink milk and eat cheese that comes from cows that get slaughtered. The only way to lessen meat production is to reduce the number of people with any kind of need or want for animal products. Maybe I'm wrong about what vegetarians aim to accomplish exactly.

[Here](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/17/blurred-lines-robin-thicke-s-summer-anthem-is-kind-of-rapey.html) are some examples of what I mean, in case someone is not familiar with the discussion.\\n\\nNow, from what I\\'ve seen, people who consider the song sexist do so mainly because of \"I know you want it\" -line and the premise of the song being trying to seduce / persuade someone having sex with them, even though that person is (or - as the song implies - pretends to be) reluctant.\\n\\nWhy I see this as a double standard, is because same kind of \"seduction songs\" performed by women have never been considered sexist, even thought the message may be exactly the same. For example in \"Don\\'t cha\" by Pussycat Dolls:\\n\\n\"I know you want it/\\nIt\\'s easy to see/\\nAnd in the back of your mind/\\nI know you should be on with me\"\\n\\nAnother example, \"Last time lover\" by Spice Girls:\\n\\n\"Do you think I\\'m really cool and sexy, and I know/\\nYou wanna get with me/\\n[...]\\nCould it be your first time maybe\"\\n\\nAnd \"Skin\" by Rihanna:\\n\\n\"So why you standing over there with ya clothes on/\\nBaby strip down for me/\\nGo on take em off/\\n[...]\\nWhen my body\\'s screaming out now./\\nI know you hearin\\' it\"\\n\\nI have never heard anyone consider these songs sexist, let alone rape-y. So - if female singers can sing about seduction, why a male singer can\\'t, without it being considered sexist? Or is \"Blurred Lines\" somehow categorically different than the songs I quoted (and others like them)? \\n\\nNote1: I\\'m talking about the song here, not the video\\n\\nNote2: I\\'m a woman and I consider myself a feminist\\n\\nChange My View!\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you for good arguments, I find my view (partly) changed! Keep up good conversation.\\n\\nEDIT 2: In case someone was interested in hearing me elaborate how my view is changed: I do think now, that there are some dodgy parts in the song that I had missed (like the part of giving drugs), that may cause some people to consider it more rape-y than, for example, the songs quoted here. I also think that the video of the song, Robin Thicke\\'s later remarks and reputation as misogynist (true or not) don\\'t help. \\n\\nHowever, I still think some people overreacted simply because a male singer was using the same phrases that female singers use all the time, because **some** feminists (no generalisation here, I\\'m one too) have become over sensitive and see rape and sexism everywhere - and that hurts most the victims of actual rape and sexism (men and women) by making the problem seem trivial. That\\'s why I don\\'t like some pop song about drunken hookup being on top of lists about sexism in society, because that makes sexism look like some first world problem.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It was generally used to dismiss why someone who is generally seen as a really genuine guy who gets the butt end of the stick. The honest man gets peace of mind, the dishonest man gets ahead. Lately, terming yourself the \"nice guy\" gets you a lot of flak because some how its been attributed an extremely negative connotation. \\n\\nThe connotation I\\'m describing is the belief that people who are nice are only doing so because of their ultimate ulterior motive to lay with anyone they are nice to. It assumes that their actions are purely manipulative and that they expect an action/reward sort of relationship out of people. I think this is a rude oversimplification of nice guys.\\n\\nIn actuality, these people just have a faith in people\\'s integrity. They are the ones that are sure to be quick and helpful about repaying a favor when someone does them a kindness. These people aren\\'t morons though--they don\\'t assume sexual attraction to be a favor (as pop-culture would tell you). The issue at play is that they are not exactly socially well-rounded, so when they become involved with a girl in a platonic manner emotional attachment comes easily and quickly. This attachment only grows as the girl sees them as a closer friend because of how much time they spend together and how many favors the guy is willing to perform for them (the notorious \"such a great friend\" line). Meanwhile, because of the nature of attraction, the man\\'s constant desire to please is sure to seat him in the also highly stigmatized \"friendzone\".\\n\\nSo the situation that arises is the man unawares finds himself with a woman whom he thought a strong bond of companionship and mutual feelings was blossoming when in fact she has not the slightest romantic interest in him.\\n\\nThe man isn\\'t expecting to hit a favor quota and receive the adoration of his adored--he is simply deluded into the idea that the more time he spends with her, the more she will realize or have the chance to realize that he is the one she has truly loved all along. Generalizing him as an asshole who is only interested in women for sex won\\'t help him shake his fairy tale mindset. People assume he only had sexual interests from the start, which I don\\'t believe is true. They then instantly shame him for even having those interests which only furthers the problem.

Similarly, you don\\'t have to keep on trying to flag down your waiter for anything.\\n\\n3) As we do where I work, you give a note with what you want to the cook. The cook makes it and gives it to you. This system cuts out the middleman.\\n\\n4) [This is more along the line of busboys,  but just in case this is brought up]: When you\\'re done with your food, bring it to the dish-room. I know most places don\\'t have a window in which you can place your dirty dishes, but that can change. If anything, just put it on a cart. \\n\\nSure, having SOMEONE in the dining area is a good idea in case someone has questions (although the cook\\'s job is to answer questions, too) or there is a special case like someone in a wheelchair needing assistance. You can have a special waiter - it doesn\\'t mean that everyone else needs one too.\\n\\nI also understand the reason of \"jobs.\" There are multiple jobs that don\\'t really do anything.\\n\\nI probably wasn\\'t looking hard enough because I searched on google for things related to \"we don\\'t need waiters\" and \"waiters are useless,\" yet the only thing that comes up is about tipping. Sorry if someone else brought this up before.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We\\'d just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I don\\'t give money to beggars on principle, I don\\'t believe it helps them and it sure as help doesn\\'t help anyone else. Instead I thought of the idea of \"giving them work\". E.g. if you\\'re sitting on a bench and there is a lot of litter around you, ask them to clean the area for 10$. If they do it, you benefit, because it\\'s cleaner around you. People benefit as well, because the area is cleaner. The beggar benefits, because they get both money and a life lesson (hopefully). It may be that they will try to use that in the future and try to make small deeds for money, instead of straight up asking for it. I know it\\'s far fetched but it\\'s better than just reinforcing the idea that all they have to do is say \"give me money\" to enough people, to get by. If the person goes for it, everybody wins.  \\nAnd if they won\\'t accept it, then it\\'s not your problem. 10$ for 10-15 minutes of work is a great deal, and people actually work by cleaning the streets for less than that. It may get to them in time, when they\\'ll be missing the 10$, or it may not. Either way I think the offer is fair and if you don\\'t take it and prefer to beg instead, you don\\'t deserve a cent from anyone.  \\nI also think it\\'s more respectable to work for the 10$, even if it\\'s just collecting litter, than just begging for it. I don\\'t remember who said it but there\\'s a millionaire that doesn\\'t give money to any charity because he considers the idea of handing people money insulting (to the people). Instead he invests in places that create a lot of no-skill required jobs, so people who want to work, can do it.\\n\\nEdit: to relieve the confusion: I\\'m not saying this is an idea to fix the problem of poor/homeless people in general. Just an idea that you can apply as an individual, when approached. Usually your only options are to give them money for begging or not give it to them. I simply propose a third solution, and considered it superior to the two, thus making it \"best\" out of three.

I\\'m Grim, and here\\'s your chance to tell me why I\\'m an idiot and yadda yadda yadda. Here\\'s the deal: I\\'m a 22 year old White Male living in the state of Indiana in the United States of America. My first presidential election was in 2008, and I voted for Obama. I\\'d already written off the Republicans as the slaves of corporate lobbyists, private interests, and Christian Fundamentalism, and I still believe there\\'s not a single republican worth my support in any way, shape, or form. I was one of those idealistic, optimistic young voters who honestly believed in the power of Democracy. I bought Obama\\'s (false)Hope hook, line, and sinker, and aside from that, I didn\\'t see any alternatives to him that were even remotely palatable. Romney and Santorum were both about as Crazy fundy as presidential candidates got, and Gingrich had Wallstreet so far up his ass that putting him in office would\\'ve been, in my opinion, only slightly less worse of an idea than electing Adolf Hitler.\\n\\nSo here I was: One vote to cast, only one option that seemed viable. I put my faith, my trust, my hope in Obama, and he fucked me. He fucked all of us. Gitmo is still open. The wars in the Middle East are still on. In some states, homosexuals still have to be afraid of being true to themselves. The rich keep getting richer, and those of us below the poverty line just keep sinking deeper and deeper into the mud. In short, I realize now that voting for Obama was a waste of my time and energy, and a huge blow to my ability to trust the American Political System.\\n\\nSo what do I believe in? Well, I like to keep it simple: I believe in an end to the Drug War, because it\\'s been a complete and utter failure and a waste of everyone\\'s time, energy, and money. I believe in an end to our participation in the Middle East conflicts, because again, we have achieved nothing: One dead dictator, thousands of dead civilians, a \"secret\" prison full of accused terrorists, who if they weren\\'t terrorists going in, I could hardly blame them for being terrorists if/when they get out. Our soldiers deserve causes worth fighting for: Not Imperial Conquest and certainly not a war that does nothing but line the pockets of the Military Industrial Complex.\\n\\nI believe in reasonable restrictions on gun ownership, but never an outright ban on handguns, shotguns, rifles, etc. I believe that it\\'s not the government\\'s business, nor anyone elses\\', who you love and who you marry. I believe in the complete and utter separation of church and state. I believe that, if corporations and business aren\\'t going to pay their employees a fair wage, then a minimum wage (That\\'s a whole other CMV) must be set that is enough for people to get by on without having to resort to working three jobs. if McDonalds can triple the pay of their CEO to 13.8 million dollars, then I can call bullshit on a raise in the Minimum Wage destroying the economy!\\n\\nI believe that education is a universal right for all humans, and it shouldn\\'t be denied to someone just because they can\\'t afford it. I believe that Climate Change being caused by humanity\\'s rising consumption of fossil fuels, and I want to see the government take an active role in shifting us away from their use, while funding and supporting alternative energies. I believe in spending our budget responsibly, and working to make a better country in the long term, so that it\\'s a country I\\'d actually want to start a family in.\\n\\nI don\\'t like either party. Neither of them are anywhere near my stance in politics, and I don\\'t know where to begin looking for alternatives, if they even exist. I\\'m sick of watching the American People elect morons and greedy, self serving jack-nozzles, and I can\\'t allow myself to be a part of that endless circlejerk anymore.\\n\\nSo here\\'s the TL;DR: Given the disgustingly revolting state of the American Political Scene, should I even bother voting? If so, then provide me with some pointers for where to look for good candidates. I\\'m looking for parties outside of the ludicrous \"Red vs Blue\" Spectrum. I still want to believe that the system can work. So help it prove itself to me.\\n\\nEDIT: Climate Change bit, I believe it\\'s man made. Also, stop reminding me how little power the president has. I\\'m using that election as an example because the 2008 was my very first federal Election, and Barack Obama\\'s deceit and betrayal had a profound impact on my attitude in regards to American Politics.

An example would be non-commissioned sales associates in stores. I used to work at Best Buy for $8/hour (not exactly minimum wage but pretty close to it) and I personally know how much time we can spend per customer. Most interactions usually last about 5min or less but it's not that uncommon to be with a customer for up to a hour (or more in rare cases). Even then, sales aren't guaranteed unlike a restaurant server. \\n\\nOver time, price of meals might go up but I why should I care about that? Ultimately there's not a significant difference if a meal is cheap and I tip 20% vs a more expensive meal but I don't tip? You might also argue that employers might fire servers who don't get enough tips as a sign of bad service but I don't think that should be the case. If a server is providing excellent service, I'm more likely to spend more like with dessert or drinks. If I'm getting bad service, I just want to leave as soon as possible resulting in less sale. Even if this system of evaluating servers doesn't work for whatever reason, employers could always evaluate based on customer surveys or by sending out undercover people to eat at their restaurant.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I wish to argue that when one looks at the situation as a whole, the Imperial Legion is objectively the lighter shade of grey.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I have had a pro-Imperial bias since before I first started playing Skyrim. Based on my experiences in both Morrowind (especially so) and Oblivion, the Cyrodiilic Empire has always seemed like a very nice place to be, and so I\\'ve always been an Imperial loyalist. I was surprised that joining the rebels was even an option.\\n\\nBut now, after having analyzed the backgrounds and motivations of both sides, I\\'m even more of an Imperial loyalist than ever. This is because of the following reasons.\\n\\n**1. A united Empire would be a stronger bulwark against Dominion aggression. Also, the Empire is generally good for Skyrim.**\\n\\nThis should be fairly obvious. If Skyrim was to secede from the Empire, then High Rock would be cut off from Cyrodiil, and could very well secede in turn. Hammerfell was already kicked out of the Empire, and whatever is left of Morrowind that has not been destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vvardenfell lies under the de facto control of the Kingdom of Argonia. (**EDIT** Argonia was actually kicked out of Morrowind due to the efforts of House Redoran.) In the event of a successful Stormcloak rebellion, the Dominion would be able to destroy the nations of men piecemeal.\\n\\nOf course, a quick and decisive victory for the rebels is not quite optimal for the Thalmor; they would prefer that both sides bleed one another out (and don\\'t forget that Ulfric is a Thalmor asset of a sort). But if they cannot have that, I\\'m sure that they would prefer to take on a bunch of smaller human kingdoms than one larger human Empire. Of course, for any of those who actually like the Dominion, this is a wonderful reason to join the Stormcloaks.\\n\\nThere is also the matter of trade and mutual benefit. Jarl Balgruuf says as much. Skyrim gets to benefit from the rich lands to the south, and in exchange Cyrodiil gets the protection of some of the best warriors on Tamriel.\\n\\n**2. Ulfric\\'s killing of King Toryyg sets a dangerous precedent.**\\n\\nAs Uncle Alvor put it:\\n\\n&gt;Once the jarls start killing each other, we\\'re back to the bad old days.\\n\\nUlfric\\'s claim on rulership of Skyrim boils down to \"might begets right\". \"Well no kidding, that\\'s how rebellions work,\" some of you might be saying. But Ulfric\\'s point in killing the king was that leadership comes from individual martial prowess. No king who cannot beat challengers in single combat is fit to rule. Such an attitude does not belong in any civilized society, because it is hazardous to stability. What\\'s to stop Skyrim from falling into civil war again in a generation if someone decides that he doesn\\'t like Ulfric\\'s successor?\\n\\nIt would have been different if Ulfric had asked Toryyg to declare independence from the Empire. Toryyg would have seriously considered it, and if he had agreed, then this point would be moot. As events turned out the way that they did, I\\'m convinced that Ulfric\\'s rebellion is at least partially motivated by his own personal ambition: he still would not have wanted to be a vassal to Toryyg.\\n\\nThere are other points to be made about the Great War, the White-Gold Concordat, the release of Hammerfell, and the Markarth Incident, but I\\'ll address those if they come up. So, rebel scum^^^I\\'m ^^^sorry , CMV if you can.\\n\\n**EDIT**\\n\\nFirst Delta goes to /u/Rdmknowledge. I\\'ve enjoyed having this discussion with all of you about one of my most beloved games.

This includes almost all sweets, many kinds of bread, sausages and convenience food. Many drugs also include lactose.\\n\\nAdditionally he is faced with development issues, he already has been receiving physical therapy for the past 6 months just to learn to crawl. The future might bring additional learning disabilities, speech difficulties and other forms of neurological impairment.\\n\\nNow why am i here:\\n\\nMy SO asked me what i think about having a second child.

Well, maybe just on reddit.  But often, I feel it would be helpful to have a clear and reliable definition of what counts as art, so the discussion could move forward.  This also addresses a common opinion that boils down to \"I don\\'t like it, therefore it is not art\".  \\n\\nAnyway, here\\'s my definition of art: \\n\\nAny form of communication with at least one layer of abstraction.  [edit: removed word attempted]\\n\\nHere is why I think this works.  It\\'s medium-agnostic, so it can apply equally well to any type of art including spoken word, performance, sculpture, whatever. \\n\\nIt\\'s non-normative, meaning we don\\'t have to consider whether the artist did a good job or had any particular purpose.  \\n\\nIt boils down to: Was there communication? (even unintentional?)  And: Was the communication abstracted in some way? By this, I mean the full content isn\\'t just explicitly stated.  \\n\\nExamples of what is not art: \\n\\nA stop sign is not art.  It\\'s communication (you stop here) but the message is not really abstracted.  \\n\\nA random splotch of oil on the ground that looks really awesome is not art, because it wasn\\'t produced by a person to communicate anything. \\n\\nJackson Pollock\\'s work is art, because there is communication about his thoughts, feelings, and art itself in there - although it is heavily abstracted. \\n\\nDifficulties/objections: \\n&gt;This idea eliminates the boundary between art and design!\\n\\nIndeed, for example stylization of text could be considered abstracted communication.  I think this is OK.  Design can be considered a type of art. \\n\\n&gt;This means really shitty art is \"art\"!\\n\\nYes, I guess it does. \\n\\nBONUS ROUND: \\nMy definition of \"Good Art\" (which I realize is too subjective to debate meaningfully, but I\\'m throwing it in here anyway): \\n\\nGood art helps one\\'s fellow humans understand better. \\n\\nHere \"understand\" means understanding themselves, others, the world around them, life, culture, etc.  It is orthogonal here to the idea of knowledge, in the sense of information that hasn\\'t been emotionally integrated into one\\'s worldview or mindset.  \\n\\nI like this definition because it encompasses just about all art that\\'s considered \"great\" while allowing us to reject art that\\'s superficially well-executed or conceptually interesting, but ultimately worthless to the human experience.  For example, Star Wars fan art is usually not good art.  Imitative contemporary abstract nonsense is often not good art.  But maybe Jeff Koons can be considered good art again?  In this light, Duchamp\\'s Fountain and Malevich\\'s black squares can be more important (to me, anyway) than ... say... Monet. Interesting!\\n\\nOkay, that\\'s it!  What do you think, is there a more useful definition of art we can use? \\n\\nHow about good art? \\n\\n____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

If I\\'m wrong in this,* please *help me see that; I honestly can\\'t, right now, and as much as I believe everything I\\'ve described below, I can\\'t help but feel like an awful person for writing off the value of an entire culture. I\\'d appreciate any constructive feedback. Thank you.*\\n\\nThe Jewish history is a history of genocide... perpetrated by the Jewish people, upon their smaller and weaker neighbors--and occasionally, by virtue of exceptional military leadership, against larger and conventionally stronger neighbors. This goes back to ancient times, but is clearly true in the present day; Israelis are gathering in public places by the hundreds, if not thousands, dancing and singing things like \"There are no children left in Gaza, Oleh!\"\\n\\nThe Palestinians are the modern-day descendants of the Philistines. The Israelis are simply perpetuating an agenda of ethnic cleansing that is thousands of years old. This is how the Israelis act, displaying overwhelming support (suggestions place public support for the ground campaign in Gaza as high as 87%; since when does 87% of any public support anything its government does?) for genocidal endeavors.\\n\\nThis lasts until they come up against somebody too strong for them to defeat alone, at which point it\\'s \"poor Israelis\" and \"persecuted Jews.\" World War II? The Holocaust was horrible. I\\'d agree. Thank God we\\'ll never forget all the Gypsies, the homosexuals, the mentally disabled, and other groups that the Nazis persecuted. \\n\\nY\\'know how they made the homosexuals wear pink triangles, so they\\'d stand out from their neighbors and could be singled out for relocation and persecution?\\n\\nWait, you didn\\'t know that? Well, there\\'s no surprise. God forbid that the Holocaust be about anyone else but the Jewish people. I don\\'t know how the history books read in other countries; in America, nobody mentions anyone but the Jews. There are no photographs of anyone else being persecuted. Pink triangles pinned to homosexuals? Shit, even a college education over here isn\\'t guaranteed to go into that, but I knew what a \"Star of David\" was when I was four years old, and why it is so awful that Hitler did what he did to those poor Jewish people (and it is awful, beyond awful; don\\'t get me wrong). \\n\\nWhat about Jewish rituals?\\n\\nKosher food is considered pure. Y\\'know why? It\\'s because the animals are killed by being first immobilized, then having their necks cut approximately halfway through with a slow sawing motion. The animal is left to bleed out in pain, as Jewish tradition holds that the slow bleeding out and suffering of the animal renders the meat somehow \"pure.\" \\n\\nLiterally, \"the suffering adds flavor\" (and, probably, another thing that was necessary thousands of years ago for health reasons, that is no longer necessary, but is one of those mindless traditions that is indulged in for the sake of being \"time-honored;\" in the case of Jewish tradition, however, this seems to pass from \\'quaint\\' to \\'sickeningly horrifying\\' without much exception). \\n\\nJewish culture is stuck in the mindset of a world that is thousands of years gone, when it was literally \"kill or be killed\" for every little tribe on the planet, and a few hundred people dead could mean the end of your ethnic group. The Jews lost 6,000,000 in WWII and are currently a stronger force than they have ever before been in human history, within living memory of the Holocaust... but they don\\'t seem to have gotten that message. Small wonder, perhaps, given that they\\'re likely fairly indignant at how the lesser races of treated them.\\n\\nJews all but invented the concept of the \"master race.\" They have a word for people who aren\\'t Jewish--*gentile*. Now, this isn\\'t so distinct from other religious groups in some fashion; southern Baptists routinely refer to other people as \"nonbelievers\" and Muslims have the famous \"infidel,\" but terms like these tend to have something in common: they denote *other people* as being *ideologically wrong* in the viewpoint of the individuals using said terminology. This is not the case with \"gentile,\" the Jews don\\'t *want* to convert you. You aren\\'t *pure*. Gentile denotes people who are, in Jewish tradition, physically inferior--as is also evidenced by their use of \"Jewish\" to describe themselves as a religious faith, as a political state, and as an *ethnicity*. Even the most hardcore Christians don\\'t identify themselves as being \"ethnically\" Christian; in fact, they\\'d vehemently deny it, stating that a person must be individually \"saved\" to be Christian. \\n\\nNot so the Jews. They\\'re superior, everybody else is inferior, and they don\\'t even particularly *like* it when someone wants to convert. And if nobody\\'s actually giving them a hard time? They\\'ll make it up; ample evidence suggests that the Jews were never enslaved by the Egyptians; it\\'s generally accepted that the Bible story of the enslavement is a complete fabrication. The Pyramids were built by Egyptian farmers and craftspeople who were paid for their labors and well taken care of, and there is no sign of the economic collapse that would have occurred had a million slaves walked out of Egypt overnight.\\n\\nIt is possible to honor your ancestors and revere those who fell in times of horrifying carnage and catastrophe without using it to justify an ongoing tradition of genocide, barbarism, and delusions of physiological superiority. Yet, not only are the Israelis not doing this, but we (America) are aiding and abetting them in their ongoing vileness. These people are targeting individual wheelchair-bound people with helicopter rockets, and beaches of small children with warships, and we\\'re paying to refill their ammunition stockpiles. It leaves me feeling positively sick.\\n\\nThey are literally one moral step away from walking into peoples\\' living rooms and skinning their children alive, or from sacrificing people to God, but you can\\'t say anything bad about the Jews. Have you ever noticed that? \"I don\\'t much care for the Japanese/Indians/Mexicans/Hispanic people/black people\" or whoever, and you\\'re at least given a chance to explain, but \"I don\\'t like the Jewish people\" makes you an instant monster.\\n\\n**EDIT:** After some richly informed commentary from /u/Hauntrification I\\'ve removed previous references to circumcision.\\n\\n**EDIT:** I\\'m grateful for all of the informed responses so far, which would be all of the responses so far. Thank you for taking the time to help me out of this. I know it sounds odd, but I sincerely appreciate it. I need to get some sleep; I will return to this topic later.\\n\\n**EDIT:** Thank you, /u/karelos  ∆ and thanks to everybody else who put a lot of effort out there into calmly and patiently explaining the concept of \"different point of view\" to someone who really ought to have had that in mind right along.

We commonly say things like \"I dont even want to go there...\" or \"thats too deep for me...\" when touching upon huge, philosophical quandaries. \\nA society which encourages critical thought and teaches us how to approach abstract questions from an early age will eventually birth a a generation of (by average) more prepared parents.

In more circumstances by average than would likely happen now, the bullying child may actually benefit from the counseling. \\n\\n3) Conformity : \\nOrganized religion, media, peers etc. all have tremendous toxic weight on society. Freeing slaves, allowing women to vote, allowing homosexuals to marry, allowing people to smoke weed..... these topics take far to long to filter through tradition. \\nCritical thinking skills arm the populace with the notion of asking \"why\", and not accepting things at face value.

There are a great many women with high sex drives, of course. But, in general I believe that men at large are more desiring of sex.

The more testosterone you produce the more libidinous you are. Men who have lower testosterone have less of a sex drive. These men seek out testosterone treatment and notice a dramatic increase in sex drive once the treatment becomes effective. Women produce significantly less testosterone than men, consequently their sex drives are typically lower. \\n\\nWomen are less proactive when it comes to seeking out sex partners. I don't have support for this one, but in my experience men are the ones who are proactive about directly asking women out or making direct romantic gestures. It's usually incumbent upon men to do the asking, to make the first move. Men are compelled to play by these rules because women are the ones who have the thing that men desire, and men are the ones who are forced to act because of the desire. \\n\\nAlso, men are much more likely to say yes to a request for an immediate sexual encounter than women are. According to [this](http://www.elainehatfield.com/79.pdf) study women were much, much less likely to say yes to a proposal for immediate sex, whereas men were much, much more likely to say yes. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=girl+asks+100+men+if+they+want+to+have+sex) video. Many of the men features men leap at the change to have sex with the girl, despite the fact that she could be leading them into some kind of trap, or that she could have an STD of some kind. There are only a few examples I know (there is another video in which is about 1:1 as well), but the average of men that say yes it much higher than the average in the gender opposite video. The ones who don't leap to sleep with her at least seriously consider doing it, this is because they want, very badly to have sex with a beautiful girl. The women in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxyySRgrYsU) video don't react nearly as positively. None of them leap at the chance. They aren't instantly aroused the way the men are by even the proposal. I think it's reasonable to conclude that the desire just isn't as intense. \\n\\nYou might argue that the desire becomes as intense when the desire is provoked, and that this situation does not provoke the desire but if it's so difficult to provoke the same amount of desire, doesn't that mean that there is less desire in general?\\n\\nCMV, please!\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I have many fond memories of playing that console at my friends\\' houses back in the mid 90\\'s but never having one myself because my mom forbade it.

Take Rogue Squadron- I remember it being high flying action with fun, dynamic gameplay and a cast of awesome characters. What I got was essentially no story and aircraft that handle worse than most flash games available free online. Jet Force Gemini- this one was the hardest for me to swallow. This was arguably my favorite game growing up and I found it unplayable. The aiming was all over the place, the camera moves erratically, and the polygonal look of the characters was terrible to look at. \\n\\nThe main point I am trying to make is that how far gaming has come today has spoiled us. These old games were fine for what they were but when compared to the titles coming out today they pale in comparison. There are some titles that are still great, however. I am not saying that all games from the 90\\'s and before are bad.

I also want this law to be repealed and for this discrimination against sexual minorities to end.\\n\\nHowever, as people who follow this issue are aware, the African nations that have these laws on their books have resisted calls to repeal these laws. They view calls for repeal as the West trying to impose its moral standards on Africa, which has expressed its morality through the passage of these laws. I am aware of the logical inconsistency of this position (i.e., that the homophobia is a result of the adoption of religion, which itself is a Western import), and do not want to discuss that here. What I do wonder is that the leaders of these nations have asked that they be respected as sovereign nations, and for the West to respect their laws. They say that just as they do not impose their cultural norms on the West, the West should not impose their cultural norms on Africa, and the most common example they cite is that of polygamy. It is very common in several African nations, but (I was surprised to learn) is actually criminalized in the US and Canada. So if the West criminalizes the African cultural practice of polygamy and is unwilling to repeal the laws that do so, then surely African nations can criminalize homosexuality and the West should leave them alone.\\n\\nI'm not sure how to mount an argument to this. The right to marry a consenting spouse is in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, so if a woman/man decides to marry another man/woman with an existing spouse, it should not be criminal as long as the three of them consent to it. And if choice of spouse (if one party is already married) is already criminal in the West, why can't it be criminal in Africa on the basis of gender?

However, there\\'s not much of a need to spend so much time on it, since, in my opinion, it\\'s just not as relevant to American life as the Constitution. While it\\'s important, it\\'s more important to teach about history that had a bigger impact on today\\'s world. The Constitution is a prime example for American life, since it\\'s still being used and referenced all the time today! When was the last time you heard of the Declaration of Independence in the mainstream news? Okay, Nicholas Cage stole it in a movie once, but other than that, nothing much.

They might also become more interested in politics in their adult lives, since they would actually know how the American government is structured. Plus, with the Constitution, it would also help teach students how America changed over time, and what the values and standards were for American people living a hundred or two hundred years ago.

For example, I was making breakfast this morning when I dropped an egg on the floor by accident for the first time in awhile.  The normal reaction that most people would make would be anger or frustration, but I instead went straight to my room to get paper towels and clean up the mess without making a fuss about it.  I seem to perform better than where I was over a year ago and stopped making mistakes recursively.  By acting like a robot, I\\'m able to do things better and faster than I used to without the emotional distractions.  I admit there are times when I have sudden bursts of emotion when I think about something (e.g. crying), but I take that as a deficiency and restabilize my mind back to \"robot mode\", which is still a challenge for me. It kind of makes me wish there was a delete function to remove memories like a computer can.  \\n\\nExplaining my life background has gotten me to the view of seeing emotion as a flaw of humanity.  Humans have been fighting each other since forever and I think emotion is what sometimes leads to bad decisions rather than using logic and reasoning.  As a result, we use our hearts rather than our minds to do things that we end up regretting in the end, like the conflicts you see on the news and the decisions we make in our personal lives.  I wonder if reddit had a different view on this.  \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We\\'d just like to remind you of a couple of things.

A quick search gives us this:\\n\\n&gt;The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture.\\n\\nWhile this is good enough I don\\'t think its sufficient. This may be the definition of art but it is hardly the purpose. The purpose of art (imo) is to convey a complex idea. And that is really what comes into question when it comes to Video Games. Nobody could really contest that a game creator uses \"creative skill and imagination\" to make their product. The contention comes when you think about whether games convey an idea or are simply entertainment. In the rest of this post I will show firstly the difference between things in a medium that do and do not fulfill the purpose of art. I will then show how video games are a superior art form as opposed to moves painting and the like. Finally Ill show some examples of games that fit into the categories of art and non-art. I realize that I\\'m dealing with a lot of abstracts here and it\\'s impossible to be truly objective, but I\\'ll do my best to represent what I mean.\\n\\n**What does and does not fit the definition and purpose of art**\\n\\nThe easiest medium for this would be photography. First ill show some pictures that fulfill neither the definition or purpose of art: [this is not art](http://i.imgur.com/rToHN7V.jpg), [this is not art](http://i.imgur.com/R3KWNYh.jpg), and [this is not art]\\n(http://i.imgur.com/3nDiflo.gif). \\n\\nThe second category is a bit more difficult, but here are some that fit the definition of art but not the purpose: [This fits the definition of art](http://i.imgur.com/SNtyCAo.jpg), [so does this](http://i.imgur.com/hgSE2zo.jpg), [and this](http://i.imgur.com/wapYmO9.jpg). They are all certainly a product of human creativity and fit the definition of art. But what complex idea do they convey, do they meet the purpose of art?\\n\\nFinally pictures that meet both the definition and purpose of art: [This is one](http://i.imgur.com/Kjjc37e.jpg),  [Another](http://i.imgur.com/GShdiyo.jpg), [I\\'d even say this too](http://i.imgur.com/lHgFjs5.jpg).\\n\\nI was planning to do music and movies as well but these media are much more difficult to breakdown and as a result it would make this about twice as long and three times as abstract.\\n\\n**Why Video Games are a Superior Art Form**\\n\\nThe main idea here is that video games are interactive. You directly experience the feeling or idea that is being represented in the work. This makes it a much more powerful and personal experience than watching a movie or listening to a song. I have never went to a friend and talked for 20 minutes about how a song in which the artist was portraying their anger and talked about how angry I was. But I have had a bad game experience and went to talk to my friend for 20 minutes about how I was mad. What im trying to say is best represented in this quote [\"...you don\\'t have to empathize with a character on a screen, the feeling happens directly to you.\"](http://youtu.be/8FpigqfcvlM?t=14m51s). Its like taking the phrease \\'show don\\'t tell\\' and moving it to the next level, \\'feel don\\'t show\\'. \\n\\nI find that games are the best art form because they fulfill the purpose of art in a way no other medium thus far can possibly hope to.\\n\\nMost of this power comes from good game design but this is also true of other forms of media. A badly made movie will fail to show the struggle of a father/son dynamic as well as \\'The Godfather\\'.\\n\\nI realize that this is going to be the most controversial pert of my post so, fell free to reply even if you think that video games are an art form but not the best as I claim here.\\n\\n**What games do and do not fit the definition and purpose of art**\\n\\nNote: I am not saying that the games listed here are good or bad simple whether or not the fit the definition and purpose of art. I\\'ll be using commonplace titles so that even people who don\\'t play very many games will have a general idea about what game I\\'m talking about.\\n\\nGames that do not fit the definition of art: [FIFA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_(video_game_series)), [Farmville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FarmVille), and [Solitaire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire_(Windows) ). You can see that most of these are simulations of things in real life and are not very creative, mostly they fill the purpose of simple entertainment or time filling. This is not to say that simulations cannot be artful as [3rd World Farmer](http://www.3rdworldfarmer.com/) is a simulation game that fulfills the purpose of art very well.\\n\\nGames that fit the definition of art but not the purpose. [Super Mario Bros.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.). Its hard to think of specific examples of this but I think the one is sufficient. Its a very creative and well designed game.\\n\\nNest are games that fulfill both the definition and purpose of art. In this section I\\'ll talk for a short biit about what parts of these games make it artful. [Amnesia: The Dark Descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia:_The_Dark_Descent), this game is fear and panic incarnate. [Mark of the Ninja](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_Ninja), ever wonder what it\\'s like to be a ninja? [Papers, Please](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papers_please), this game is really difficult to describe, pretty much you are a worker at the boarder of an oppressive dictatorship, it\\'s definitely worth a play if you are looking got something truly unique. Lastly [Antichamber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichamber), for if you ever want to break your brain.\\n\\nWith games, I have added a 4th category that comes directly due to interactivity. These ae games that *can* be art. I think what I mean by that will become more clear as I show some examples. [Call of Duty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_duty), of course you have the well known \\'12 year old who slept with everyone mother\\' but many parts of this game are powerful message about what war is like; there are better representations of this but this game fits this category very well. [League of Legends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends), this game can be anything from a mindless time sink to an immersive experience where you directly experience victory, defeat, panic, triumph, fear, and even the occasional sportsmanship. [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyrim), this is truly the best representation of this category, anybody who has played can tell you about the amazing landscapes (I just gotta freak out for a second, when I first saw the Soul Cairn, my brain exploded. And the last area of the main quest just makes you feel like a bad-ass who has crossed worlds to beat this evil, its just awesome). The potential art in this game is immense, from the world design even to how the character interacts allows the player to fell and be something the never could. This is what I mean by the category *can* be art. These games fulfill the purpose of art if the player makes it so.\\n\\n**TL;DR**\\n\\nGames are a superior art form because they have interactivity and allow the player to directly feel the idea that is being conveyed by the creators. This at its core fulfills the purpose of art better than any other medium can. All media have things that are art, and that are not art. Just because you can point to some games that are not artistic does not mean the medium is invalid as a form of art.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

They have convinced me that I have misunderstood the argument as well as others misusing the argument. When people talk about birth control being a right, they are not talking about (or shouldn\\'t be at least) a basic right but rather a contractual one for health care to cover meaningful expenses. Thanks everyone for their input and discussion! \\n\\nEDIT 2: I\\'m still continuing this discussion even though my view has been changed on part of this issue. I might just create another CMV since the issues I now raise are different but I will do my best to continue to respond to comments as I have time between studying and my final today. \\n\\nSo Lena Dunham has once again caused another stir in the social justice world by asking twitter why they need birth control. First of all, even as a woman, I find that an extremely childish point of view. To \"need\" birth control. (I would like to preface this by saying that yes I am aware of the various conditions that birth control aides, and for the sake of this CMV, those are not what I\\'m talking about here). For all non-medical reasons, no one needs birth control.\\n\\nI am a huge advocate for safe sex, and the prevention of pregnancy and the spread of STDs through birth control and condoms. That being said, I don\\'t think sex is a basic human right. No one needs to have sex every three days or they\\'ll face death, maiming, etc. Sex is pleasurable and sex is fun and sex can create life. But by no means is it a necessity in the way that many claim it is. Furthermore, claiming that your healthcare should be required to cover birth control outside of health concerns because it\\'s a basic right is absolutely ridiculous.\\n\\nIf you are not prepared to make birth control a priority by budgeting for it, then you need to make the decision to either practice unprotected sex and face the consequences or abstain until you can afford to make birth control a priority. Here are some of the main reasons why I think so:\\n\\n* Birth Control doesn\\'t have to be super expensive, as low as $15 a month.\\n\\n* If you can\\'t afford $15 a month for birth control you definitely can\\'t afford a kid and should be able to abstain until you are more financially stable.\\n\\n* There are other non-penetrative methods for sexual release\\n\\n* If you can\\'t make birth control a priority for your own personal budget, then why should you expect your health care to. \\n\\n\\nI know this treads very closely with past CMVs on birth control being included in health care, but in this case I think it\\'s hard to talk about one without the other. I personally think persecuting company\\'s for refusing to provide birth control in their health care package (not that the woman couldn\\'t just buy it without insurance!) is as assine as getting upset if an orthodox jewish meat company refused to purchase pork for their work cafeteria. \\n\\nI feel like I\\'m one of the few feminists (and I use that term very loosely) who doesn\\'t believe that sex is a basic human right.

I have never been a sports fan and I find obsessing over sports ridiculous.   Not mearly watching a game, but the obsession of them.  But that is not what this CMV is about, I just think its important and fair to be clear where I\\'m coming from.  \\n\\nWhat this CMV is stemming from is that I watched a documentary last night, \"Schooled, the Price of College Sports\".  If you want a more in depth understanding you can watch it or I\\'ll just give the very brief summary (as I understood it).  \\n\\nOne side says players should be compensated for the \"work\" they do.   The other side says it is essentially extra-curricular activities and they are students merely taking part in activities while at college and that paying them would ruin college sports.  \\n\\nNow, this was a pretty slanted documentary but I was still able to appreciate the perspective from both sides.  On one hand the reality is that college sports players are part of a big business that makes lots of money.   On the other hand school should exist for learning not creating a big, profit making businesses centered around sports.  \\n\\nMy view is this:   The problem is not the coaches or the schools making money and not paying the students, afterall they all just have a job and are trying to be paid as best that they can.  Fine, I have no issues with that.   On the other hand those students are making a LOT of money for other people and not seeing a dime for it.   What the problem really is to me is that people should stop supporting the entire system altogether.  Paying $50, $60, $100 or more...    If you want sports entertainment you should go pay professional sports entertainment.   The only reason those sports should exist within a college setting is for the players themselves, something to do on the side while they\\'re attending school.   The moment the populace starts being willing to pay them vast sums of money and pay such a mind to star college athletes, they have become the problem.    Leave the students alone to learn and do what they want to do on the side while they\\'re there.   I say the fans are the only solution to the problem because both the NCAA and the Student-athletes are right in what they say.   The fact is, there just shouldn\\'t be that much money being generated for college sports and the only reason there is, is because fans are obsessive and willing to pay ridiculous amounts of money to them.   I believe fans are wrong to do this and should stop and that if you\\'re a fan of college sports, a paying fan of college sports, that you should stop contributing to a problem that can only be solved by you ceasing to provide them so much ridiculous money.  \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It is a vehicle for the wealthy to accumulate wealth from the poor. \\n\\nAlso, there is no choice. If you want a loan, or have a bank account, you MUST pay/receive interest. There is no way you can withdraw your consent on ideological grounds: therefore we are trapped by interest. What are the results of this? It means payday loan companies like wonga can carry out state-sanctioned theft of your possessions and home to cover your debts. It means that you are penalised for not being rich. To say this is allowed when really there is no way you can disagree with the system seems wrong to me.\\n\\nBut why ban it?

So the main benefits of interest seem to be - compensating financiers for lending money, allowing small businesses to have access to capital, and allowing people to own items they otherwise wouldn't be able to. I am realising that economies will grind to halt if financiers cannot make money out of lending money without a viable alternative.\\n2. There does seem to be an alternative to interest in the form of Islamic Banking, whereby interest is not charged. Another system has been illustrated by /u/ProjectShamrock [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2begsn/cmv_interest_should_be_banned/cj4iq4y) Whether these are good or bad systems is still unclear to me, but it illustrates alternatives are possible.\\n3. The way we charge interest in western societies directly empowers financiers. It is banks who decide interest rates, not their customers (who lend them money when they open a bank account) or the borrowers.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The majority of my knowledge comes from a few Super Meat Boy speed runners and Dark Souls 2 speed running. \\n\\nIt seems a common tactic in the speed running community to use tricks in the game to quickly get ahead. This is exactly what you would expect from someone trying to finish the game as fast as possible; however, often times these \"tricks\" can cause the player to completely skip a large portion of the game. My main example would be what\\'s referred to as the Brownie Skip in Super Meat Boy. \\n\\nBrownie is a boss in super meat boy on the world called the Salt Factory. In order to beat him, you have to outrun him through a maze like structure and get to the top of the structure. Doing this normally could take a little longer than a minute. Perhaps less, I don\\'t know the exact amount of time, but definitely significantly more than when using the exploit. Performing the Brownie Skip, the player is placed into the race, runs immediately to the right outside of few and pauses the game and then ends up being able to land on top of the platform that was initially impeding their progress. If you don\\'t know or that explanation didn\\'t make sense, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvT8CQWYbxM) is what it looks like. \\n\\nIn my opinion, this and tactics like it don\\'t belong in speed running. While it does make you beat the game faster, you\\'re not actually playing the game. You\\'re playing \"who knows how and when to pause the game and how to wiggle the stick\" the best. The idea of speed running is about being able to beat the game the fastest and bosses are an important part of the game. Actually beating the boss shows off more skill by far.

Surely this legislation would make it such that dangerous mentally ill people cannot obtain firearms, making the world a safer place.\\n\\nBut consider this. A man returns from active duty and decides that he wants to purchase a pistol to protect himself.

Can an 4 - 10 year old give consent? that is almost a definite no. But past that, if a kid can give consent to be picked up, to be punched by his friends, to ride a bike, to ride a car, why can he/she not give consent to sex? Of course, this view must hold that those even those younger than 10, those that can speak, can give consent, but I won\\'t go there in this, as I will get a bunch of hate mail and witch-hunts as is common in western society\\'s irrational hatred of anyone defending the \"pedos.\" So, what makes sex so taboo for children? I argue that it is subjective. You grew up seeing it as dirty, so you don\\'t want your or other\\'s children engaging in it, because you see it as dirty, and want to keep their \"innocence\" for as long as possible. Other crimes such as murder, assault, and robbery are much more objective, they do clear harm, and clearly violate another\\'s right to life, their body, and their property. So, to expand on this. If a 12 year old can give consent to a 14, or something of that sort, why then, can they not give consent to someone much older? It is because **you** view it as icky. I will admit, in the majority of cases, the child is a victim of rape. So, clearly, if the victim speaks out soon or later, the case should be looked into, and prosecuted with the right evidence. But, it is clear to me, that if a 14 yo can give consent to a 16 yo, then he can give consent to anyone.\\n\\nOn to the next part, sex offender\\'s registry is complete bullshit. First of all, I fucking hate background checks. They perpetuate poverty, and only cause more crime. It makes it hard for criminals to get jobs, and they resort back to crimes. On top of that, sex offenders are treated so much worse. Why does raping someone, adult, or child, make you so much worse than someone who murdered and didn\\'t get life? It is bullshit. There is the argument, \"but then how would we know if there\\'s a sex offender living next door to my children!\" Well, that\\'s incredibly unfortunate that you don\\'t get to know everyone\\'s backgrounds so you can keep your precious little critters safe, but that should be your responsibility. People make mistakes, but should be able to return to being normal human beings, citizens, when they do their time. Not to mention that the prison system does not help pedophiles change their ways at all. That needs to change as well.\\n\\nFurthermore, the most egregious of these I find, is the acceptance on reddit (though, suprisingly, the internet is far better at condemning this than the regular population) to pedophiles being beat, stabbed, and raped in jail. Reddit and 4chan are actually decent compared to regular society in recognizing that this is **fucking insane!** It happens way to often. And there is little activism against the abuse sex offenders get in prison, or even abuse in general in prison.\\n\\nSo, I clearly feel very strongly about this, you\\'ll get bonus points from me if you change my opinion about that last one. But, CMV about all of these I guess. If a good argument comes a long that I haven\\'t thought of, I\\'ll change my view.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I have attended competitions, and known several friends who cheerlead, and though I am a very active, physically fit person, I would still find it challenging to learn and execute many moves in cheerleading, and find it impressive and enjoyable to watch.\\n\\nHowever, I don't consider it a sport. This is not a pejorative assertion, but even so, I have experienced pushback for it in the past. I also don't subscribe to the Olympic definition of sport. In my view, a sport needs to be able to be won by objective means. That is to say, you need to have a goal that can be reached: make it to a certain point first, score more points, lift the most weight, etc. Obviously, officials make wrong calls, and goals in hockey/soccer for instance are wrongly disallowed/wrongly given occasionally, but at the end of the day, there is still an objective result/outcome, but for the number of games they decide on the merit of the mistake alone, I'm willing to consider them a reasonable minority. Team A 4 - 3 Team B, Usain Bolt wins race with time of 9.68 seconds, etc. I believe events decided solely by judges cannot be sports, and will always be subjective in nature. Sports like boxing, with judging elements, are still sports in my view because there is an objective way to win - knocking the opponent out so they cannot respond to a 10 count, for instance. The judging is a tiebreaker, and I am fine with that. But in judge-only events, an identical routine could win one contest, and lose another, simply by virtue of human subjectivity alone. For this reason, I lump cheerleading in with figure skating, diving, and other events as athletic activities.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Make it a rule that unless sacrifice of some sort factors into your gift, you are not being generous.  Therefore, if I donate money to an AIDS research foundation and as a direct result cannot buy the new fancier computer I wanted, then I am generous.  If a millionaire donates proportionately the same amount but it forces them to change nothing, then they are not.  The bigger the sacrifice, the more generous the person.

You absolutely are and clearly those who have more and give very little of it help finance things more than a collective of persons with meager wealth.  The point I was initially making was that \"generous\" is a very high praise to offer someone and I feel that it can at least sometimes be perceived as a cheap way earning praise for very little.  I\\'m reminded of [the Biblical story](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12:41-44) of the woman who gave her last cents in offering and was praised by Jesus as giving more than anyone else.

By doing this, eBay are trying to force sellers to satisfy 100% of buyers. Because there is some irreducible percentage of buyers who are unreasonable, this is never going to actually work. Getting an unreasonable buyer is random, and accordingly there will be sellers who get pushed out due to nothing more than the bad luck of getting several unreasonable buyers in a row. No matter how good you are, your eBay account now has a half-life.\\n\\nThis is a consequence of an American cultural malaise, \"five-star-ism\", the drive towards unreasonable standards of perfection, and the perfect is the enemy of the good. A pass is a good mark. Three star service is actually good service. Three stars means that it wasn\\'t noticably great or noticably terrible; you just got exactly what you wanted. Every transaction that you did today, that you didn\\'t even notice, what you got there was three star service. You deserve three star service. What makes better service better, is that you didn\\'t actually deserve it.\\n\\nIn a sane world, if you get better than acceptable service, that\\'s four stars. If you get the best service you\\'ve ever seen, that\\'s five. If you were disappointed in some way which is clearly attributable to the service provider, but you still got more-or-less what you wanted, that\\'s two stars. If they were completely incompetent and absolutely failed you, that\\'s one star. (Or zero, if they intentionally angered you.)\\n\\nHowever, those who decide these things in eBay, Uber, Walmart, Blizzard, various American call centres, etc etc have all somehow come to the bizarre decision that \"acceptable\" should mean five stars, and anything less than five stars, is unacceptable. I took an Uber ride the other day. I rated the guy five stars, for no other reason than that I knew that if I did not, he would be punished. He had done nothing wrong. He did exactly what I expected of him. No more, no less. He deserved three stars. I wanted to be able to give him that rating without any concern for his continued employment (well, his contract).\\n\\nThis state of affairs completely grinds my gears. It destroys the very purpose of having rating systems at all. It converts the rating system back to a binary, \"bad/good\", with no meaningful distinction between those ratings. Worse, it makes no actual provision for recognition of genuinely good service. If you rate any seller who sent the thing out in acceptable condition within acceptable time as \"five star\" - how do you fairly rate the one who sent it out quicker than you expected, better packed, and the item in better condition than you were told? How do you rate the Uber driver who showed up early, got you to your destination quickly, and had a great conversation with you?\\n\\nAm I wrong? Have I missed something here?\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We\\'d just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I know this is considered tabboo to many people, but here are my views:\\n\\n* **Why I prefer well-done steak**: First of all, by well done, I mean brown all the way through, which is not the same as completely burned so that the steak resembles a hockey puck in appearance and flavor. I have had some phenomenal steaks cooked well done at moderate-to-upscale steakhouses, and the outside was barely charred at all. After trying steaks cooked to a variety of temperatures, I feel that well done is the best according to my tastes. I don't feel that the flavor is substantially lost by cooking the steak for longer. Of course each temperature has its own distinct flavor, but I do not feel that a properly prepared well-done steak sacrifices much, if any, flavor. The same goes for texture, if prepared properly. That said, in general, I prefer my food cooked all the way through. When I cut into a rare steak and am greeted with a bright-red gush of raw beef and blood-like juice, I completely lose my appetite. Presentation is important when eating such an expensive meal. Finally, a fully cooked steak reduces the probability of picking up a foodborne illness. So it's a win anyway you cut it (pardon the pun).\\n\\n* **Why there shouldn't be a stigma around ordering well-done steak**: First of all, I'm the customer, and it's my money. I have heard that *some* restaurants (not all, obviously) might give you a [worse cut of meat](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/13ktn5/til_if_you_order_your_steak_welldone_in_a/) if you ask for it cooked well-done. This is unreasonable and contrary to the spirit of a client-focused food service industry, where the customer orders (and pays for) a meal and the restaurant delivers. If restaurants or chefs are unwilling to start with the same quality ingredients for all orders regardless of specific customer requests, then they should expressly forbid such orders on the menu, so that customers with particular preferences can choose to dine elsewhere. I used to work in a restaurant (not a steakhouse, though), and am never adversarial towards a server, so I should expect the same when I am a customer.\\n\\nEdit: spelling.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Instead of privatizing education, we should be focusing on how to reform the public system.\\n\\n\\nI went to private schools all my life. I still go to one. The endless tales of bad teachers that we hear about in public schools, can be accompanied by an equally long list of bad private school teachers.\\n\\nLet add to the pot of bad teacher stories:\\n\\n\\nIn 6th grade, I had trouble writing. The private school my parents paid well over $20,000/year in tuition couldn\\'t even tell me what was wrong. When we changed schools, we found out what the issue was.\\n\\n\\nWhen I was in 7th grade, my math teacher moved to fast for me. I had to take an extra class from the learning support specialist, which was effectively my math class. \\n\\n\\nI also had to take a Christian studies course. When I asked the teacher questions such as \"If God is omnipresent, why is he spaceless and timeless?\" I was given a vague answer. Any student who asked a hard question was given an unhelpful answer (though that might be a problem with religion rather than with private schools). It wasn\\'t an honest and objective analysis of Christianity, rather it was a circlejerk of \"God is Great!\" Or \"Praise Jesus!\" I could\\'ve used that time more effectively with the learning support specialist.\\n\\n\\nIn 8th grade, my math teacher was incompetent beyond words. Literally all the parents and students hated her. The only reason that amalgamation of cells was ever hired was because, school policy required that both the husband and wife be employees at the school. She started off each morning with a prayer which, she could\\'ve used as time to help struggling students. Instead of helping struggling students, she would talk about her kids, proselytize during class or make us ask our peers. She also made me take a test, when I was jetlagged. Again, the learning support specialist had to pick up the slack. Then there\\'s my personal favorite of these stories from her: she made the Asian kids teach for her. Funny thing is, we could\\'ve been spared from her. There was an applicant, whose qualifications went beyond an accounting degree (and having an SO who got a job at the same establishment). The reason he wasn\\'t hired? He was agnostic. Instead of caring about the students, the school cared about an agenda.\\n\\nI had to take that Christian studies course again in 8th grade, and we were shown a video from Ben Stein\\'s Expelled and they contested evolution in that class. I\\'m okay with the Bible being taught as mythology but, to challenge scientific fact is utter bullshit. \\n\\n\\nIn my 8th grade year, there a someone in my grade whose parents were getting a divorce. He became depressed. The school which practically made us memorize the sermon on the mount, decided that the most Christ-like action possible was to suspend him. What good what that have done? He would\\'ve been brought closer to the divorce. The divorce is what made him depressed in the first place. That\\'s what Jesus would do? I think what Jesus would do is get the hell away from the school campus.\\n\\n\\nIn my 8th grade year, there was a band teacher who had an ego bigger than Mount Everest. He made all the band students play in his good-bye concert. There was one kid who had to attend a funeral, which happened to be on the same day as the ego concert. This guy\\'s Christ-like action? He threatened to FAIL the kid if he didn\\'t go to the concert. \\n\\n\\nThrough all these examples, I\\'ve shown that teachers can be just as incompetent and egotistical as public school teachers.

The belief that some people constitute better biological stock than others is hard to swallow; we do not choose our genes, and none of us like the idea of choices being made by others for our own supposed benefit. We believe that we have a right to reproduce, a right to bodily autonomy, that precludes government control of reproduction. Our individualist society places ultimate worth in the individual; no matter how beneficial something may be for the collective, it is *wrong* if it infringes on the rights of the individual. This is faulty reasoning, and an indication that we are out of touch with reality. The 'individual' does not exist; we are continuously and overwhelmingly shaped by external forces outside of our control (our genetic code, our upbringing in childhood, the societies in which we live). In turn, our actions shape the genetic makeup of the future, shape the future families and societies. This being realized, it is clear that to place the individual above all else is to suppose that each individual's self-interested actions will eventually benefit the collective as a whole. Adam Smith called this the [invisible hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand). Of course, Smith was referring solely to economic growth patterns, which are not necessarily good indicators of true progress. One need only comprehend the devastation wrought upon the Earth as a consequences of the Industrial Revolution to see that economic growth may not be a good thing after all.\\n\\nThroughout history we have been shown that in a competitive, individualized society, [that to which we are all entitled quickly becomes degraded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). Which brings me to my point; something to which every individual feels entitled is the production of children. We shudder at the thought of someone other than ourselves controlling our prospective children. We can see no reason for another entity to restrict our ability to reproduce. However, such reasons do exist, and they are quite powerful. Among these are:\\n\\n1. The introduction of a child into the world is a fundamentally violent action. Parents do not ask for consent when they have children; they are forcing the world to accommodate the presence of their child. All parents hope that their children will become self sufficient and ultimately benefit the world around them, but clearly this is not the case.\\n\\n2. It has long been known that [less intelligent people have more children](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_and_intelligence). This inverse relationship between IQ and fertility has worried scientists since industrialization in the 19th century. It has been shown that [IQ is largely heritable (&gt;66%)](http://www.toqonline.com/blog/the-fall-of-man/), with the conclusion being that the Flynn Effect is a phenotypic consequence of better nutrition that masks our steady [downward spiral of genotypic intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Fragile_Intellect).\\n\\n3. Not only are less intelligent people predisposed towards having more children, but our society encourages diversion from intellectual pursuits. The explosion of mass media and popular culture is very troubling; [the average American spends 5 hours a day watching television](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/average-american-watches-5-hours-tv-day-article-1.1711954). We have entered an age where selection *for* beneficial traits has reached an all time low, and so has selection *against* deleterious traits. Plastic surgery, infertility treatment, deodorant, simple and repetitive jobs, the [welfare state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticisms_of_welfare), makeup and fashion, lack of disease and natural predators, the list goes on. Now more than ever there exist a multitude of forces that accommodate genetic weakness, and allow these individuals to reproduce with the same vigor as those who are more genetically fit.\\n\\n4. The world is experiencing a real crisis of of [overpopulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation), and consequential deterioration of the natural and built environment. It is said that education will lead to lower fertility; of course I agree with this! And that is precisely the problem; the educated and intelligent people decide to have fewer children. Those who are unintelligent (either through lack of education or lack of aptitude) will *always* have more children if it is in their self interest to do so. The potential economic worth of a child is hard to overstate when one is living in poverty.\\n\\nTo summarize my points, I believe that when an individual makes their contribution to the gene pool of the future by reproducing, they are perpetuating their own genetic deficiencies to the detriment of not only their descendants, but those who will live with their descendants. Note that I would *never* suggest that genetically 'weak' people be killed. They deserve all the compassion that we should grant to any individual. It is this compassion that I feel towards future, unborn individuals that leads me to believe that eugenics is necessary. Human civilization has reached a point where natural selection no longer favors intelligent, cooperative, sociable, and moral individuals. It is a world where anonymity and division of labor have enabled the potential for everyone to survive and have children. But such survival is not thriving! The value of a population is measured in its quality, *not* its quantity. With [dysgenic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgenics) free-reproduction, there is very little that encourages high quality, low quantity births, and very little that discourages low quality, high quantity births.\\n\\nAs to how such eugenic goals may be realized, I point to [China for inspiration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy). Incentives for individuals to have few children is the first step. Once the total birthrate has become low enough to maintain a stable population, measures can be taken to improve genetic structure of future born children. These might involve extensive sperm &amp; eggs banks where individuals identified as genetically fit (i.e. high IQ, non-criminal, genuinely altruistic, physically well-formed/healthy) could supply the majority of new children. People on the lower end of the genetic spectrum could still raise children, provided they pass certain tests/background checks ensuring that they will not be abusive and corrupting. (I propose *all* people pass these tests to qualify as adoptive parents, even genetically fit individuals)\\n\\nI foresee that responses will suggest that I am placing too much concern on heredity (that is, I am giving undue weight to 'nature' over 'nurture'). To this I contend that we often underestimate the power of heredity. Of course, all humans share common ancestors if you go back far enough. It is generally accepted that we all came from the [same initial genetic stock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogenism). But the reality is that our physical manifestation is determined mostly by the genetic structures of our parents, and our environment in the womb, infancy, and early childhood. Our brains are physical organs, whose physical form is determined almost entirely by genes. People have long recognized the importance of the brain, and many attempted to [physically deform the brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_cranial_deformation) for mystical or social reasons. [Heredity is recognized](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/under-the-influence/201204/intelligence-is-not-just-genetic) as the [major determining component](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1520-iq-is-inherited-suggests-twin-study.html#.U8fsNPldV8E) in intelligence, among [other behavioral aspects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_study). \\n\\nIf you wish to change my view, you will have to convince me that:\\n\\n1. Dysgenic collapse is not only not imminent, but impossible. I see no difference between it happening 100 years from now, or a thousand, or even a million. The threat of its occurrence must be dealt with at *some point*. \\n\\n2. Individualist and 'free' society (where no government oversight over reproduction exists) can counter dysgenic trends of its own accord. Show me that people are willing to embrace [technology that will rewrite the genetic codes of fetuses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designer_baby), rendering concerted natural-reproduction eugenicist efforts unnecessary. \\n\\n3. That a future with dysgenic collapse a la Idiocracy is not necessarily a bad thing, so long as an elite exists that will 'take care of' the unwittingly enslaved humans.\\n\\nI look forward to seeing some responses soon.\", 'op-title': 'CMV: Dysgenics is real, and the only way to avoid collapse is government control of reproduction.', 'pair_ids': ['p_886'], 'train': 1})}),\n",

What is a successful species?**\\n \\nA successful species is the one that exploits its environment most efficiently. Growth (general reproductive success) is a response to an exploitation of the environment. As such, humans are the most successful large animal species on Earth.\\n\\nI don\\'t think human beings should sacrifice some of this success for the environment. No other animal would self-inflict population control.\\n\\n**2. The inherent value of the environment.**\\n\\nThis touches on whether the environment is worth preserving or not. As a species, we\\'re at a point where we depend on the environment for survival. Therefore, the environment has utility. The environment also has aesthetic value for most people.\\n\\n**3. Is there a moral obligation to sustain the environment?**\\n\\nNo. This is a whole different CMV, but I don\\'t think morality is the ideal method of determining whether or not a population/society should do anything. On an individual basis, morality is useful, but it has extreme subjectivity. I feel that, although not perfect, utility is often the more reliable system for societies. No system of value will avoid subjectivity, and all can be twisted in the same way.\\n\\n**4. My point.**\\n\\nI use the word \"necessarily\" in the title because if the solutions we develop allow us to continue to exploit the environment in order to support the growth of our species, then so be it. I don\\'t believe, however, that the environment on Earth will be able to support the growth of humanity indefinitely. Therefore, a more ideal solution is to create synthetic solutions. I don\\'t think it\\'s TOO far fetched to imagine generators creating the perfect atmosphere for human growth, synthetic food being healthier and tasting better than traditional food sources. Gardens in place for aesthetic purposes.\\n\\nI know this is probably a very scattered/incoherent point of view, I\\'m still thinking about it.

Under this proposal, the northern and southern portions of New York would be separated.  Long Island, New York City (the 5 boroughs- Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island), and Westchester County would belong to one state, whereas all NY counties north of Westchester would be considered another. Albany would remain the capital of the northern region, and Manhattan would become the capital of the southern state.\\n\\nThe state of New York is considered to be a \"blue\" state. However, one may find that the geographic majority of New York is actually conservative.  While New York being considered a \"blue\" state accounts for the majority of the people living in it, it excludes the vast geographic majority.  This is due to the fact that southern New York is very population dense.  There are 19.5 million people living in the state of New York.  8.3 million people live in New York City, 7.5 million people on Long Island, and a little over 960,000 people living in Westchester County. This means that out of the 19.5 million people in the state, 2.75 million people make up a region of 52,186 square miles (NY as a whole, minus the 3 regions I described above). The liberal south of the state is deciding how the many conservative areas are run. A resident of Long Island or NYC may find it dangerous and unnecessary to own a gun.  However, you\\'re likely to find signs that blatantly oppose the New York [S.A.F.E Act](https://www.governor.ny.gov/nysafeact/gun-reform). The political atmosphere of the geographic majority of New York is very different from that of the populous majority. Dividing the state in two would allow for the two regions to make political decisions that respect their populations.  Currently, the rich liberals in New York City and its surrounding areas neglect the rest of the state.  This would not be an issue if decisions made in Albany (the state capital) affected the nearby counties, and not those hours away with a different atmosphere and different views.  The different areas have different needs- let\\'s serve them better.\\n\\nTaxes are also high in New York, as is the cost of living.  This, once again, is likely due to the fact that the standard of living in most of New York City, Long Island, and Westchester is ridiculously high. In Westchester and Long Island, you have your stereotypical white, upper-middle class, picket-fence families. In New York City, you have the city that never sleeps; a global economic driving force.  As a result, people in the more rural parts of New York face harsh taxes, since these people make up a majority of the state.  By isolating the people of the southern region, the northerners would pay reasonable taxes while the southerners would pay appropriate taxes.  Those who can\\'t afford it, or those who choose to pay lower taxes may want to move to the northern state.  I believe that the northern region\\'s economy could be managed with the help of metropolitan areas such as Albany, Syracuse, Utica, Buffalo, and Ithaca.  There are also many universities in these areas (many public schools and more than enough private schools) that would continue to stimulate the economy.  The southern region would have no problem sustaining itself. \\n\\nBut, I could be completely wrong. CMV.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Morisette is accessing the culturally shared vision of the woman who has been planning a wedding since she was a little girl.  The rain shows what little control we actually have and exposes how our expectations do not meet reality.  \\n\\nThe guy who is in the plane crash says \"well isn\\'t this nice\" (verbal irony).  Also he has a reasonable expectation that his plane would not crash because that is a very rare occurrence, and it is the first plane trip he ever went on, but it crashed creating a mismatch between expectation and reality (situational irony).  I suppose the man expected the plane to crash because of his fear of flying, so it is not ironic for him, but the characters around the man probably expected that he would end up somewhere safe.  \\n\\nA traffic jam when you are already late is not very ironic I guess.  \\n\\n10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife creates the image of a person going through a collection of flatware thinking that eventually there will be a knife.  the expectation that a huge collection of flatware would have more than just spoons seems reasonable, but that expectation is challenged by reality (situational irony).  \\n\\nThe free ride when you have already paid is also ironic because winning anything beats the expectation of not winning already expressed by the character\\'s buying of one ride (situational irony).  \\n\\nMeeting the man of your dreams accesses a shared and unrealistic (but nonetheless present) movie magic fantasy of falling in love.  This expectation is immediately crushed when you meet his beautiful wife.  This is cosmic or situational irony.  The idea that you are an important part of the universe and you have a fate or destiny that is significant is pervasive.  When the universe torpedoes that expected reality, you have cosmic irony.\\n\\nThe most common rebuttal I am familiar with is that her examples are more about bad timing or bad luck.  To that I say that there are many instances of bad timing or bad luck that create ironic situations.  Irony, timing, and luck are not mutually exclusive factors in any described event.\\n\\nA less common rebuttal I hear is that I am seeing more than what is there.  According to this argument, irony must be tacky and cranked up to eleven.  I disagree.  Subtle irony is irony too.  Also literary analysis through describing imagery is acceptable in both prose and poetry.  I feel that Morissette was unfairly criticized because of her gender, age, and medium (pop music).\\n\\nThe final rebuttal I am familiar with is that Morissette agreed with many of these criticisms and defended herself by admitting that she did not understand irony that well.  Her admission needs to be taken into context.  It was made after many intellectuals tore her song a new one.

What I mean when I say they should function as stop signs is that one should be able to stop, observe the intersection and, if it is clear, proceed with caution (similar to how right turns on red are currently executed). This would increase efficiency when driving without sacrificing safety very much, IMO. I feel like when I drive there are a vast number of occasions when it would be *completely* safe for me to go through the intersection, but it’s technically illegal until the light turns green. I’m sure the majority of other drivers experience similar situations. This wastes everyone’s time and even money (gas is burned while idling). This is especially true in the middle of night when there are times when you’re the only vehicle on the road where you’re driving. \\n\\nThis obviously wouldn\\'t work at every intersection, as some intersections just have too much traffic going in too many directions, so here\\'s my disclaimer that I agree there are exceptions. However, I do think these intersections could have a \"no turn on red from 7 AM - 6 PM\" or something, rather than a hard rule. I see signs like this in the city all the time. This way when there is no traffic at 3 AM people aren’t just idling at red lights for 2-3 minutes.

I think I understand exactly what people mean when they say it. I just don\\'t personally find myself using it or thinking of something as being overrated, because of the way that I think about art and media, and I wish more people could see things the way I do. \\n\\nBut I\\'m looking for someone to shed some light on what they think overrated means, because maybe I\\'m taking it to an extreme that others are not. \\n\\nWhat I mean is, generally when people say something is \"overrated,\" they mean, \"this is critically acclaimed or appreciated by a huge number of people, but I don\\'t like it. Therefore, I don\\'t understand why so many people like it, or I do not think it deserves the praise it gets.\"\\n\\nI personally do not believe in superlatives or assigning \"greatness\" to something that is purely subjective. I am a huge movie buff as some of you might know, but I don\\'t have a personal list of \"greatest movies\" because I don\\'t think you can rank movies based on which is \"best,\" since everyone has different criteria. However, if you asked me what the greatest movie ever is, I might say VERTIGO or CITIZEN KANE, because there is a consensus among critics that it is either one of those two movies. Therefore, when I say \"VERTIGO is the greatest,\" I am NOT stating an opinion, I am referring to the consensus of the canon of film criticism. \\n\\nI think greatest in these sense refers to \"most influential\" or \"most written about\" or \"most often said to be the best by people who are in the business of saying such things,\" in which case \"greatest film\" could be an objective label, because I think influence and popularity are objective qualities, as opposed to the subjective act of enjoying something. I don\\'t think there is necessarily one film that is MOST influential, but it is inarguable that some films are just more influential than others.\\n\\nLet\\'s move on to the Beatles: we all know that time and time again on CMV, it\\'ll come up that someone thinks the Beatles are overrated. I think, based on my criteria for \"greatness,\" the Beatles are certainly great. It is hard to ignore the impact they had on pop culture and pop music, and they are undeniably legendary and well-cited in literature and criticism, and not without reason. When you say \"the Beatles are overrated,\" you\\'re saying either, \"I don\\'t like the greatest band of all time, so how can they be the greatest?\" or \"because I don\\'t like them, they shouldn\\'t have been the greatest band.\" The former statement is going against my own interpretation of what people mean by greatest, as I said before. You are allowed to dislike the Beatles but still understand that they had this great impact. The second statement, whether they deserved to have had that impact, is prententiously insisting that your sole opinion is the only correct one. Rather than try to do research and understand the impact the Beatles had and figure out why they are called great, you just kind of gave up and decided that you HAD to like them, or they are automatically \"overrated.\"\\n\\nI think the problem is that people see things or listen to things called the greatest and assume it means that it is going to be the thing they enjoy the most. They hear that CITIZEN KANE is the greatest film of all time and think, well, that means that if I watch it I will have the most enjoyable experience I have ever had watching a movie. But CITIZEN KANE is considered great for reasons that are not readily apparent to the average, modern viewer. It\\'s basically the 1941 equivalent of a Chris Nolan film: groundbreaking practical special effects (yes, they\\'re so good that I bet most of you are scratching your heads wondering what effects I\\'m even referring to), temporally complex narrative, technical innovation, incredible camerawork, makeup, and a young and spirited director at the helm. It\\'s great in its historical context, but its also great because critics \"decided\" it was great, and it became a sort of cultural meme that everyone just assumes is true. If you wanted to say, \"CITIZEN KANE is overrated because I have done extensive research and study and have written a peer-reviewed critical analysis demonstrating how it did not really have the great influence and impact that it had\" (something people have done) then you would be going somewhere. But if you said, \"CITIZEN KANE is overrated because I didn\\'t like it,\" you are misunderstanding what is meant by \"great\" and you are too lazy to do the research to see why it earns that label.\\n\\nUltimately, you\\'re just missing out on a chance to enrich your cultural understanding and find out why things are beloved in their context, even if you don\\'t personally care for it. Personally, I have never found a single thing to be overrated, because even things I dislike, I understand WHY they are liked and why they are influential, because I am interested and invested in understanding popular culture. I know that not everyone is as into it as I am, but if you\\'re not, why even make the criticism to begin with? And if you\\'re posting to CMV saying something is overrated because you want to understand it, why not say \"I don\\'t understand why people like this,\" rather than make the presumptuous statement that implies other people are wrong for liking it?\\n\\nCMV. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Rather we should congratulate them for hard work, not assuming that they are special.

I'm sure many of you are familiar with the subreddit /r/tumblrinaction. I'm posting here because I don't really get why so many seem to like it. I feel like I'm going crazy here, because I just realized that the sub has so many of the same qualities as /r/shitredditsays, a sub that I really dislike.  \\n\\nI want help to reconcile these differences.  \\n\\nSome things I noticed:  \\n\\n* Hyperbole and misrepresentation. Obviously it's a circlejerk sub, but I really feel like people there actually believe what they say about what feminists believe. I lurk /r/femradebates a lot and have learned a lot about both MRM and feminism there, and have noticed a huge disconnect between what's said there and what people circlejerk about in TiA. What TiA says about feminists is like what SRS says about MRAs.  \\n\\n* Outrage culture. It's been getting really bad there lately.. it used to be pretty chill but people are getting so angry and worked up that it feels really toxic now. I browse /r/tiadiscussion and a lot of people seem to agree. There was even a sticky mod post about how to deal with rage... http://www.reddit.com/r/TiADiscussion/comments/29atw2/official_discussion_thread_dealing_with_rage/  \\n\\n* Missing sarcasm/obvious jokes, and circlejerking about the opposition anyways. SRS does this a lot with regards to MRAs and they get a lot of flak (rightfully) for it. But then I see things like this on the front page of TiA: http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/2ag1wy/schizophrenia_does_not_exist_um_because_culture/ and am starting to think that you can post almost anything fake from Tumblr to circlejerk about.  \\n\\n* Starting to attract actual bigots. SRS can get really bad with the actual communists (eg. Mao/Stalin apologists) and that sucks. I'm a Muslim and I really hate how Tumblr tries to speak on our behalf, but I hate Islamophobes way more. Threads like this: http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/26ag1l/tw_real_life_british_police_let_up_to_50_girls/ were really disheartening to me especially because the article itself was so sensationalist and pretty much made shit up. I had the OP of that thread tagged as an Islamophobic white nationalist before so it sucks to see that actual bigots can get away with using the sub as a political soapbox. :( Plus the whole 4chan vs. Tumblr thing showed that there were a lot of 4chan.org/pol/ users there.. a place that's legitimately fucked up.\\n\\n* Touching the poop. SRS likes to see themselves as the white knights of reddit who like to call out reddit, but TiA is starting to act like ShitTumblrSays more and more. It's supposed to be a humor sub not the sub that keeps watch over the shit that Tumblrinas say. This one feels so weird... people are even starting to act like the Tumblr police: http://www.reddit.com/r/TiADiscussion/comments/2af4pv/is_there_are_way_to_report_people_on_tumblr/ that's just what SRS likes to do too when they cry to the reddit admins???  \\n\\n* This last one is really petty but I feel like the cult of personality around the mods has been getting a bit over the top. The mods of TiA are treated like the archangelles of SRS... it's really weird to me.  \\n\\nI thought about this for awhile, and I first thought that one major difference between the two subreddits is that TiA doesn't ban anybody with a different opinion like SRS does. But when I thought about it some more I realized that since SRS is so unpopular and TiA is so popular that TiA doesn't need any mod enforcement to make the sub a circlejerk. ~~I remember seeing someone try to support Affirmative Action on the sub and they got hammered with downvotes even when they were being completely reasonable.~~ (this part made the thread go in a direction i didn't care about so I'm removing it)\\n\\ntl;dr: I'm starting to dislike TiA because it's become like a mirror of /r/shitredditsays. Please convince me where I'm wrong! It just feels really weird to laugh at SRS types when the sub acts just like them.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nedit: I'm gonna head to bed. I enjoyed reading your responses and will respond to as many more as I can when I wake up. I kinda got distracted by arguing about affirmative action when i didn't really want this thread to focus on that, but that's my fault. I'm just looking for arguments that the sub is moving in a positive direction away from being a mirror of SRS!\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

For example, sexism, or the notion that women have no place in the public sectors of business and government, and racism or the idea that different people are automatically born to menial positions in society because of the color of their skin. Just in very recent years, people have finally begun getting past homophobia, or the notion that gay, lesbian and transgender people should be denied rights and considerations which heterosexual people take for granted.  \\n\\nBut one area where old-fashioned social taboos are still relatively untouched is the area of dress codes. We judge one another based on how we dress, and we do so for the stupidest reasons. As the wiki explains:  \\n\\n&gt;In practical use, dress codes are either followed intuitively or enforced by peer pressure, so that people wear similar clothing in the same situations.  \\n\\nThat doesn't tell you the half of it. Judgments about clothing are inflexible and automatic, with no appeal. For instance, if I were to go into work next week and announce that I have decided that I am a woman (I am a man), my colleagues would be supportive, enthusiastic and curious. However if I came to work wearing a [dashiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashiki) and a [kufi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashiki), they would assume I had lost my mind. If I came to work wearing a cape, underwear and cowboy boots I might face termination. \\n\\nThe consequences of stepping outside accepted dress codes can be severe, and nobody thinks twice about the prejudices and odd assumptions that underlie our attitudes about clothing. In certain fields, for example business and law, failure of men to wear the standard western business suit or women to wear the Condoleeza-style western pantsuit can have dire if unofficial consequences. However talented or hardworking or good at your job you might be, you can quickly find yourself essentially ostracized, disrespected by your employers, clients and colleagues, mocked, and driven out of the profession. Almost exactly like a termite with foreign pheromones, your colleagues will turn on you and eat you alive. \\n\\nFor fun, here's the famous scene in [*American Psycho*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cISYzA36-ZY) that brilliantly satirizes our obsession with dress and dress codes.  \\n\\n**TL;DR - for all of western culture's progress in terms of getting rid of old prejudices, [western dress codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code_\\\\(Western\\\\)) are almost absurdly driven by social prejudice and fear of what is strange, unusual or different. There's no actual benefit to having such inflexible dress codes, and therefore this needs to change. CMV.**\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

So far when it comes to changing my view, you guys are 3/3, so I figured I'd post another opinion of mine.\\n\\nIn general, I am pretty accepting of other people's views, but I absolutely cannot stand pacifists. I am completely dumbfounded that any intelligent human being could ever be naive or idealistic enough to believe that violence is always wrong. I can't even begin to understand that mindset. What, do you think if you're nice to people, everyone will just be nice back and we can all sing *kumbaya* while smoking a peace pipe? What happens when some asshole comes around who values your possessions more than your friendly disposition? \\n\\nTo clarify, I don't mean people who think violence should be a last resort, because that is pretty much everyone. I mean people with the specific mindset that violence is *always* wrong and stooping to it makes you as bad as your enemies. They're weak, pathetic, spineless, cowards that would rather lay down and die than fight to defend themselves. And, at least on some level, all of them are pretty much hypocrites. Sure, Mr. Amish Guy, it's really easy to talk about how unnecessary violence is when you live in America *and have the entire US army to defend your worthless ass!* Try pulling that crap down in Cartel, Mexico, or maybe Warzone, Africa, and see how it works. I've never once heard of a pacifist compound surviving completely independently, without any cops or soldiers to defend their retarded philosophy.\\n\\nThe thing is, I don't like having this reflexive disdain for any group of people. I normally hate guys who are willing to just write people off because of their views, but I can't help it in this case. Please CMV, show me the worth of pacifism as a belief.\\n\\n**EDIT: Alright guys, show's over. A lot of you helped me realize that pacifism, counter intuitively, does require a lot of inner strength, but I want to thank /u/NevadaCynic for showing me that pacifists do have value and a place in our societies. I want to thank everyone for taking the time to come in here and have it out with me, it's been a fun experience. So far, this sub has gone 4/4 for changed views.

In any case, those threads are dead and difficult to revive. There are new points that I would like to bring up.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the most part this concept is only discussed in politics, but I would like to shift the discussion away from politics as much as possible. I think this problem exists in social media on a complicated level that we haven\\'t fully defined yet. I really hope someone here is able to put what I am attempting to describe in better words than I can, or help me understand if I\\'m missing something. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe definition of satire is: \"the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people\\'s stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTV shows such as SNL, The Colbert Report, and South Park use excessive satire, usually to prove a point that is part of the creator\\'s belief system. Let me point out that satire is a beautiful thing that helps us understand others beliefs in an entertaining way, but I think it has gotten to a point where it is more damaging than progressive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTV shows like South Park and The Daily Show have been on air for nearly 20 years. Children of the late 90s and early 2000s have been subjected to heavy amounts of satire from childhood and into adulthood. As a result, I believe that satire has become so heavily ingrained into the brains of emerging adults, that it is having very negative side-effects.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese side-effects are making it \"cool to hate\". I see so many examples of this throughout social media. For some reason (and I don\\'t know why), it is considered cool to hate the actor Nicolas Cage. Through social media and online memes, these strange ideas have spread. Suddenly, many people of the younger generation decide to bash Nicolas Cage and claim he is a terrible actor with complete ignorance or reasoning. We see the same thing happen with many other celebrities as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut okay, Nic Cage is just a celebrity and it shouldn\\'t matter, right? But I can\\'t help but see this blind hate emerging everywhere. It extends itself to stereotypes as well, and this is where I draw the line. I believe it has gotten to the point where it becomes cool to hate women. It becomes cool to hate hipsters. It even becomes cool to hate different websites such as Facebook, Reddit, or Twitter. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reason I believe this is a problem is because it promotes a lot of ignorant and aimless negative thought. And I understand that it has always been \"cool to hate\" in one form or another, but nowadays we are subjected to it 24/7 in our Facebook feeds, on our mobile phones, in our music-- everywhere. This hate surrounds us so much that it becomes such a normal part of our day and is accepted as \"okay\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe worst part about it all is that it doesn\\'t promote healthy and thoughtful discussion. If someone is accused of satirical slander, it\\'s easy for the accuser to avoid defending themselves by ridiculing or saying \"it\\'s only a joke, calm down.\" There is truth in all jokes, and I don\\'t think it should be taken lightly in the world we live in today.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSatire is manipulating truthful, original, and thoughtful discussion. The reason I posted here in the first place is because I know this subreddit doesn\\'t tolerate the \"cool to hate\" mentality. It is all about progression and original thought.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I may be discussing two separate issues, and I encourage others to help organize my thoughts. I\\'m very interested in getting down to the core of this issue. I sure as hell hope someone can change my view, because it\\'s leading me down a rabbit hole and I\\'m seeing a dark and passive-aggressive future ahead of us.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Anything else is unfair.\\n\\nThis is true regardless of how I feel about any particular law. I want all corporations to supply birth control, but since the Supreme Court has ruled that some don't I believe none should. Since the Hobby Lobby decisions applies to corporations, it's now creating unfair competition because religious companies can save money on insurance.\\n\\nLaws that affect actual people are even more important, because that's discrimination. In the US your right to practice your religion is constitutionally protected, and so is my right to not practice your religion. Yet if I want to take peyote, the federal government has essentially said I must convert to a religion that allows it.\\n\\nThe only exception I've thought of is the tax-exempt status of religious organizations. Personally I don't think they should be exempt at all, but you can probably make a compelling argument in favor. However, they could just be covered by the same laws as non-profits without requiring their own special tax code.\\n\\n**EDIT** I repeat: this is not an argument about whether the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the correct side in the Hobby Lobby case.

This happens with any sort of turn based combat in RPG games. I should point out that Grand-Strategy games like Civ or Total War are not what I\\'m talking about here. The games themselves aren\\'t what\\'s boring. I thought that the two I mentioned above had cool premises and were super detailed in lore, two things I love about games. But when the combat started, the nice flow that I had been experiencing stops. I\\'ll try and list the things that bother me.\\n\\n1. Action Points: I get the reasoning behind them but they limit what I want to do so badly I want to throw my computer out the window. They simply seem unrealistic.\\n\\n2. Enemies: Perhaps it\\'s because I never played long enough to get better equipment, but every time I play and try to attack I always miss at point blank range. However at 100 yards the enemy seems to be a dead eye with every shot.\\n\\n3. Turns: Things will happen to my guys on an enemy turn that I can\\'t react to like I would in Age of Empires, Company of Heroes, etc... and it seems unrealistic. One time I was playing Xenonats and the aliens made one of my soldiers go nuts and started shooting everyone. IRL and in RTS games you\\'d move your guys away and try to kill the crazed soldier, but nope, I had to sit there and watch three of my guys get slaughtered because it was the \"Enemy Turn\".\\n\\nI know I\\'ll probably get responses like, \"Oh well you just haven\\'t played them enough\" or \"You sound like you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing\". Which are both true, but the games make me so mad that I don\\'t want to even try and get better. In an RTS if I accidentally lose my tank to an enemy emplacement, that\\'s my fault and I should have been paying attention more to the situation. But it could have happened in a split second, far to fast for me to react, and that doesn\\'t bother me because shit happens like that IRW all the time. In a turn based game if I miss it, I have to sit there and watch helplessly as the enemy takes it out and I watch the camera hover over the wreckage as if to say \"Look dumb-ass, ya coulda stopped it, but you got too frustrated.\"\\n\\nI do really want to have my view changed on this.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If I recall correctly, my friend argued that he was successful because he did not in fact take a tempered approach, but instead that his tactics were very in-your-face, citing his quote that freedom cannot be attained by simply asking.

For example: tell someone that what they did was racist, not that they're racist and they should feel ashamed (even if they are)\\n\\n- Equality not only means being able to achieve the same result as another person, but being able to achieve it with the same ease/difficulty\\n\\nOpposing belief:\\n\\n- Equality for any oppressed group can only be achieved by empowerment of the oppressed group, enabling them to go their own way\\n\\n- Gains need to be won without any connection with the oppressor, because they're not going to help. If they were, they wouldn't be oppressors\\n\\n- Feminist activists should take what's rightfully theirs instead of waiting for it to be handed over to them\\n\\n- You're better off berating someone who practices intolerance to express the seriousness of what they've done\\n\\n- Criticizing an intolerant person's character might make them reconsider their positions\\n\\n- Activists have been trying to educate for a long time, and the hate is still flowing\\n\\n*TL;DR - What serves modern movements like the fights for women's and minority rights better: the approach of MLK or that of Malcolm X?*\\n\\nedit: formatting\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I've got a bit of a dilemma that I'm interested in discussing with you all. I hope this is the right place, and I think I need an opposing viewpoint on all this.\\n\\nMy SO and I are to be soon getting married. We've been looking through the guest list and noticed that some family members and friends are homosexual (a couple of lesbians and a gay). \\n\\nWe are both atheists, and hold no religious views whatsoever, however, I have always firmly held the belief that marriage is something that celebrates heterosexual partnership, and I would be extremely uncomfortable seeing men/women dancing/kissing people of the same sex at the wedding. \\n\\nThere is also the problem that one of these people is single, and like to try and seduce other women. I'm not sure how to deal with her as this would cause great disapproval from both sides of the family, and potentially alienate us from family members.\\n\\nI'm also worried that family members would think our wedding was a 'shambles' for having them invited in the first place.\\n\\nMy SO and I have already made the decision that we aren't going to be inviting any homosexual partners, as we don't want them to be a part of the wedding. But I'm still very unsure about the remaining homosexuals...\\n\\nAnyone care to weigh in?\\n\\nEdit: Some people seem to think that I'm a terrible homosexual hating 'bigot' - I'd like to point out that whilst yes some certain groups of homosexuals actions do wierd me out, I personally do accept that homosexual relationships are just as valid as hetrosexual relationsips. I'm happy that my friends are happy with each other.\\n\\nMy main concerns are:\\n\\n1 - That I'm worried, because these individuals are heavily into gay culture that they will act 'very gay' and almost make the whole wedding about them being gays at a straight wedding look at us. \\n\\nand \\n\\n2 - That because of the above, my family members won't remember my and my fiancée's special day as a wonderful memory to be cherished, but a shambles that's best left forgotten, shame on I_Like_Food_Lots for letting his wedding go on this way... I appreciate that these people *are* bigoted, but they are my closest family all the same and I want to make them feel special with us.\\n\\n\\n**EDIT 2**\\n\\nI have to go now but thanks to everyone who contributed, even those who were somewhat negative, everyone is entitled to their opinion!\\n\\nI've enjoyed this and can honestly say my view has been changed. I've given the delta to those who I think helped but please let me know if I mistakenly missed you. I won't be able to respond any more but please feel free to continue to post, I may be able to come back and talk some more later, however again I'd say that for now I think my problems are on the way to being resolved and I now see how wrong I was in my old view. \\n\\nI'm going to talk to the partygoers who I think may cause a scene and just ask them to tone it down for the day - just the same as I would with any straight person who would act the same way. I'll point out that I'm not singling them out *because they are gay* but because of the way they act as a person.\\n\\nI'm also going to talk with my family members and let them know that this is our decision and that I want them to support us on out big day, hopefully I'm just overreacting and there won't be an issue. But if there is I think a lot of you are right in saying that excluding people says far worse about me than anything else ever could.\\n\\nThanks guys, I wish you all successful and happy days and great lives :)\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

None of these even come close to CD quality, though CD quality might be overkill.\\n\\nNetflix is really the larger offender in this regard.

I like to fill up my bookshelves with my favorite books, movies, games, albums, etc. Some people hate gathering that stuff. You can still buy the songs off Amazon or iTunes if you find a physical collection a pain.\\n\\n**Selection**\\n\\nThe selection across pretty much all streaming services is crap. Even disregarding currently airing shows, which I can wait for, there\\'s plenty of stuff that probably won\\'t ever get licensed, ever. It\\'s just impossible to license a billion and one self-published films, and having to deal with foreign content publishers seems crazy. There\\'s just too many individual publishers for a single monolithic streaming service to ever have a satisfactory selection. It\\'s not happening. \\n\\n**Ownership/Licensing/DRM**\\n\\nThe part I despise the most. With subscription services, you don\\'t pay for your own media. You pay for access to someone else\\'s collection. Spotify suddenly can\\'t get a deal with Sony? No more Sony music for you. Netflix finds your profile fishy? lol no more Netflix for you.\\n\\nMy CDs or DRM-Free MP3s? The only way to take those away would be to physically break into my house and steal them. I can lend them to a friend, or hide them in a chest in some kind of attempt to preserve them. If I so please, I can throw them away and forget they ever exist. I can make copies to keep across all my computers. I can take them to France and they will continue to work fine.\\n\\nI guess this could be flipped on its head to say \"you don\\'t have to worry about keeping track of your stuff\" since it\\'s just on their servers, but I seriously doubt there are many people who care that much for that particular convenience.\\n\\nOh, and stop putting DRM on content I actually payed for.

Had we been living on a different planet, on a different solar system, we would probably have a different length of day.

It\\'s only a matter of time. Sorry for the text wall.** \\n\\nWell, let me add a caveat to my original statement. What I was trying to say was that it would be a much bigger deal if they were using this on a large scale to effectively entrap an average citizen.\\n\\n&gt; \"You\\'d be told only, ‘Be at a certain truck stop at a certain time and look for a certain vehicle.\\' And so we\\'d alert the state police to find an excuse to stop that vehicle, and then have a drug dog search it,\" the agent said.\\n\\nJust from the information in this article, it appears that they are using this for pretty serious crimes like very large smuggling operations of guns and drugs. And, while I personally still don\\'t find this to be entirely kosher, its also not a surprise. If they were, for example, using this to profile an average person like you or me and then trying to entice us to commit crimes that we wouldn\\'t normally commit I would have a much bigger problem with it. That would be entrapment. But, here, we\\'re talking about people who are KNOWN to be committing serious and sometimes violent crimes on a regular basis and they\\'re using the information to help catch them in the act.\\n\\n&gt; \"That\\'s outrageous,\" said Tampa attorney James Felman, a vice chairman of the criminal justice section of the American Bar Association. \"It strikes me as indefensible.\"\\n\\nI tend to agree with this sentiment and I am fully aware that this is the start of a very slippery slope which could EASILY turn towards using it against people who haven\\'t actually committed a crime yet (in a sort of Minority Report, pre-cognitive way). And, even more conspiratorial, I can imagine this becoming a tool in societal engineering in the sense that it could be used to stop political movements before they start. But, I am not convinced that this is actually happening... YET.\\n\\nSo, back to the original post concerning why people don\\'t already massively protest this... it\\'s because this is a very grey area that many people wouldn\\'t have a problem with even if they knew for a fact that it was happening. As I said in another comment, this system still requires them to find traditionally admissible evidence with a warrant, they still have to do the grunt work after this guides them to the honey jar.\\n\\nI see some possible futures when it comes to the whole topic of secret surveillance in general.\\n\\n1. they get greedy, use this on lesser and lesser crimes and it eventually becomes so widely known that people become scared that its not \\'just\\' drug dealers and gun runners anymore. This sparks more widespread outcries and activism and the public finally denounces it forcing it\\'s power to be restricted or revoked.\\n\\n2. Law enforcement attempts to make this sort of evidence admissible in court publicly, a national debate ensues, and again the power of warrantless information is legally neutered due to public pressure.\\n\\nEither of these paths could end in two ways, peacefully or violently (as in not-so peaceful protests) BUT, I simply do not believe that the citizens of the United States or any other country will somehow continue to allow this to progress out of complacency or some crap like that. Take the civil rights movement, for example. The things that instigated the massive protests to end racial segregation were not small events, they were events that affected thousands of black people. People could SEE everyday that there were two bathrooms for blacks and whites, that they weren\\'t allowed to get an education, that they were physically beaten and killed by police and even civilians, and that they were loudly and unsympathetically abused verbally all occurring over the course of years and years. It wasn\\'t like one day everyone just said, \\'ok enough, today we\\'re gonna end racism\\'... it was a slow buildup of events and the voicing of opinions by MLK and hundreds of other social leaders that created an eloquent, logical, AND emotional foundation which opposed the discrimination that was occurring. They provided the guidance of why it was wrong, why the general public was REQUIRED to force a change, and gave them the belief that they COULD change it. \\n\\nNow, look at the surveillance issue. There has really only been one major event that was on par with something like a mass hanging or seeing someone beat to death and dragged behind a truck and that was the revelation of all the documents from Wikileaks/Snowden. That was the point at which the public at large became initially AWARE at all that this was even occurring while, previously, it would have sounded like every other conspiracy theory. At that point we had ground to stand on because we had hard evidence of this illegal and morally objectionable practice. Sure, it\\'s been going on for a long time and many people have KNOWN that... but there was really no evidence to back it up previously. No one had been illegally detained (referring to Manning), no one had been forced to flee the country for being a whistle-blower (Julian Assange/Ed Snowden). Now, these things have been harped on by media outlets for YEARS. People have been forced now to put thought into it and we are starting to build a community of LEADERS who serve to maintain awareness and build confidence that something can be done about it.\\n\\nI know that this is long winded but I think it\\'s important to contextualize what is going on by comparing it to previous issues that are somewhat similar. \\n\\n&gt; By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change [in the civil rights movement] was balanced by the movement\\'s strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals... Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform was driven home on Capitol Hill by the combined efforts of the Kennedy brothers, Dr. King (and other leaders,) and President Lyndon Johnson.\\n\\nThree MAJOR societal leaders who were respected and outspoken were ASSASSINATED and this was after about 15 years of the unrest building and building. Unfortunately, this is what will most likely have to happen (or something on this scale) before real change occurs. I would love if massive political upheaval were quicker and easier to effect, but... its just not how it works.\\n\\nIt WILL happen eventually and many terrible things will likely be perpetrated when it comes to the surveillance state but we are really at the whim of inciting incidents to help motivate the citizenry. Without something to point at and a powerful, relatable leader like JFK or MLK to push the issue into the collective consciousness of the people, we will not see the major changes we are hoping for.\\n\\nAssange, Snowden and Manning started this thing but they, with all due respect, are not in a position to do what needs to be done beyond what they\\'ve already accomplished. They can\\'t tour the country giving powerful speeches, they are not generally viewed as charismatic people, and they aren\\'t even in the country anyway. **Occupy wall street failed because they didn\\'t have strong leaders going for them.** JFK was the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MLK was a reverend and a speaker on par with the very best. Both revered members of society in the eyes of the general public. I can\\'t think of a single person who fits that bill in the present day. Obama is clearly not that person, in fact, no politicians at all could hope to fill those shoes. I don\\'t know who COULD live up to that challenge but it will happen. Something reprehensible will inevitably occur perpetrated by the NSA/Law Enforcement and it will be the tipping point, leaders will emerge naturally and organically. More and more ordinary people will start to be NOTICEABLY affected by this surveillance and the wave will break as it always has and always will. I am not worried at all that this apocalyptic, Orwellian nightmare will ever even come to pass. If it does, it will be quite short lived and met with the wrath of millions of people who simply won\\'t accept it.\\n\\nIf you read all that then I TRULY appreciate it, I am very passionate about this topic and I only want to serve to provide a bit of confidence to people who are afraid that this will simply become the norm and we\\'ll all just have to grin and bear it. I strongly believe that that will not be the case.\\n\\n**EDIT: I\\'ll say that my view has been sufficiently changed to hand out some deltas. For one, I can now see a few intrinsic, immediate downsides that can arise simply from the fact that you are being surveilled. I agree with the idea that just knowing that it is happening can change your behavior and instill fear even if the data isn\\'t directly used. Although, I still feel that the data itself is not exactly necessary for the government to oppress its people if they wanted to do so, rather the act of collecting it is, firstly a huge red flag that absolutely SHOULD cause mass protests, and secondly, serves to erode our rights in a subtle way that paves the path for further infringement and, by doing it slowly and maintaining the guise of protection through surveillance they are softening the collective feelings of our society towards similar legislation.**\\n\\nThanks to those of you who commented\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The world is not perfect.\\n\\nEven though both those statements have an equal value of being true, if we believe that the world is governed by a perfect, loving, supreme being, we would feel a lot happier.\\n\\nTherefore, before anyone even enters a church, they are already primed to want to believe one statement over the other, even though they know rationally that both statements are equal in value.\\nIt\\'s a positive outlook bias that our brain performs in order to lead our minds into believing things that make us feel good inside.\\n\\nNow let\\'s look at these statements:\\n\\n- When we die, we are reborn and live eternally.\\n\\n- When we die, nothing happens.\\n\\nThe first statement makes you feel better, therefore you\\'re more likely to believe it.\\nWhat happens after that, is the church plays on anticipation.\\n\\n- When we die, we go to Heaven where we are blissfully happy and reunited with our loved ones.\\n\\n- When we die, nothing happens.\\n\\nIn the first statement, you have something to look forward to. In the second statement, you have nothing to look forward to.\\n\\nThis is the same as flipping a coin and getting a hundred bucks if it lands on heads. Even though you know rationally that either possibility is just as likely the other, you want to believe more that the coin is going to land on heads.\\n\\nSo, is the church converting massive amounts of people weekly because Christianity is so obviously true?

I feel about it pretty strongly and all of these are basically going against most relationship advice I hear that is considered mature, while my mentality is often regarded as shallow or immature. I wand to understand better where the other side is coming from.\\n\\nTitle explains it summed up, here are my arguments and additional views that may be relevant:\\n\\n1. Relationship is not superior to being single and should not be searched for at all cost. Relationship should be wanted only when there is a person you want to be in a relationship with.\\n\\n2. You either want someone or you don\\'t. You are either attracted to them or you aren\\'t. They can be nice and compatible, but if they aren\\'t what you want, there is no point in trying to make it work for the sake of being nice or fair. Relationships aren\\'t deserved.\\n\\n3. Preferring physically attractive people does not make you shallow. In fact it is shallow to assume that relationships are so important that person\\'s preferences in them determine their whole depth as human beings.\\n\\n4. There is no objective measure as to what should or shouldn\\'t be changed for the sake of your partner. You have to take the person for what they are and not imagine you will change them, or compromise and change yourself for them (unless it is a change you want to make yourself.) For example, it is considered unreasonable to expect your SO to stop talking to someone you don\\'t like, but it is reasonable to expect your SO to stop drinking every day. In my opinion, no one owes their partner a change, and no one owes a relationship - you can leave over anything you don\\'t like and you don\\'t have to change anything you don\\'t want to. BUT there should be no hard feelings because neither side is a bitch or a jerk for their choice. It\\'s not a moral issue either.\\n\\n5. No one owes a relationship. It is ok to only want sex with someone hot over wanting a relationship and looking for \"deeper\" things, that isn\\'t in any way a moral issue.\\n\\n6. Standards aren\\'t objective, even though many people might share the same standards. You don\\'t have to give back everything you expect, you simply have to know what you want and someone either fits or doesn\\'t.\\n\\n7. It is stupid that people get offended for not being someone\\'s type. You aren\\'t hurting anyone by not wanting to be with them over something, even if they think the reason isn\\'t fair. Relationships aren\\'t favors or rewards anyway. \\n\\n8. There is no bad reason to end a relationship. I keep hearing people say how someone broke up with them over something dumb - think of it, the dumber the reason someone breaks up with you over, the more it means that the relationship wasn\\'t that important to them in the first place. Which means the break up was necessary, even more so than when people in love break up over something big and understandable. \\n\\n9. Being with someone, or staying with someone, you don\\'t want the most is harming not only you but them as well. Someone might like them more than you do, so committing yourself while not that attracted or for the sake of keeping the relationship effort was put in is in fact disrespectful to the other person. Therefore they should not get angry but understand the situation.\\n\\n\\nEDIT /u/KrayonFisher made me reconsider the point 8 by pointing out that emotions aren\\'t constant. I still agree with point 8 in principle, but emotions can be deceptive. Sometimes we are made to feel we want to leave someone we actually really like because of some insecurities, protective mechanism or baggage from the past. That was a valid point and people should analyze their reasons rather than just break up at the drop of a hat. It\\'s still ok to leave over anything, but you have to be sure you yourself are aware of what your reasons are. \\n\\n\\nEDIT 2: /u/upvotz4u changed my view drastically by talking about polyamorous relationships. I suggest everyone interested to read that whole argument, I found it very interesting and it affected how I see things a lot. So now I would say, the issue is the general flaw in most monogamous relationships and way they work, that are now that I think about it, almost built to ruin the partners to each other by putting burdens on them that almost no person can carry and restricting them when their partner can\\'t provide what they need. A different approach to relationships all together seems much healthier and avoids most of the issues i mentioned here.\\n\\nHowever problem still is that these type of relationships may not be something many people can handle, at least not at this point. But a lot about them makes so much sense to me that now I would change the focus of this view all together because it is only a little part of a much bigger problem underneath.

Although I disagree with the anti-abortion view, I don\\'t think it has anything to do with religion or excessive government control.\\n\\nThe chief anti-abortion argument is that fetuses are alive. Whether life begins at conception, 5 weeks, or whatever is not the point; wherever you draw the line, the motivation behind prohibiting abortion is to save lives.\\n\\nSome people\\'s beliefs about when life begins are determined by their religion. But I see no reason why religion should be the *only* determining factor. Unless you think it\\'s okay to kill newborns, you can\\'t criticize someone for wanting to protect a 9-month fetus.

Were I in the UK, I would definitely say \"American Football\" and \"Football.\"\\n\\nTo give you some perspective, I am a football (NFL) fan, and in the past year I got much more into watching the games. I really enjoy watching football. When I was able to, I watched some of the World Cup games, and I did enjoy watching them, but the whole time I just wished I was watching football. Just to clarify, I really hope someone can change my mind because I really enjoy watching football and I would love to be able to enjoy watching soccer as well! I feel like there\\'s more of a global following for soccer, and that might have some fun implications.\\n\\nThat said, I\\'ll get into it:\\n\\n**Things that bug me about watching soccer:**\\n\\n* In football, people often slam into each other at full speed. In soccer, it seems to me that any accidental unavoidable contact results in a penalty. The penalty at the end of the Netherlands - Mexico game basically completely decided the game, and as I recall, it didn\\'t seem (at least to me) that it was intentional. As I recall, it was almost unavoidable, but it decided the entire game! One guy was trying to kick the ball, another guy was near him, and their legs touched, and that\\'s the game! It was so unsatisfying.\\n\\n* If penalties aren\\'t being called on the players, it seems to me like the players are *constantly, desperately* trying to get the refs to call penalties. **It seems like every time two people come within a couple of inches of each other, one of them intentionally falls down, looks at the ref angrily, sometimes pretends to hold their leg in pain, and in the case where a penalty isn\\'t called, gets up and continues playing as if nothing happened (in other words, they were obviously faking an injury).**\\n\\n* You can watch a game go on for 60 minutes and have nothing happen at all, then sneeze, and miss a goal. At least in football, you know when a play is going to start, so you know when you have to pay rapt attention. In soccer, it seems like you have to stare at the screen for 45 minutes straight for fear of missing a goal. \\n\\n* The penalty shootout feels like a cop-out. I know it isn\\'t realistic to just keep playing for forever, but I was really rooting for Chile, and I was really bummed at how they got knocked out.\\n\\n**Things that I like about watching soccer**\\n\\n* Fewer commercial breaks. I really do appreciate this, although it goes hand in hand with #3 above.\\n\\n* Global community. In football, the \"Philadelphia\" Eagles is just as likely to have someone from Texas or Alabama or Oklahoma as Philadelphia. In soccer, I really enjoyed watching the players get tearful as they sang their National Anthems. So awesome!\\n\\n* Although I do think the penalty shootouts are a bit of a cop-out, while watching Chile and Brazil\\'s shootout (as well as Costa Rica and Greece) I was definitely enjoying myself, and on the edge of my seat. On one hand, it is sort of a cop-out, but on the other hand, it is similar to a game being won by a field goal at the end of a football game.\\n\\n**Things I like about football which are absent in soccer**\\n\\n* I feel like football has more structure. There\\'s more room for strategy, there is more variability between the positions, and there\\'s a variety of different plays (screen pass, ground attack, long bomb, short pass, play action, etc). It may be that soccer has similar strategy and I just don\\'t know about it. Further, football seems to have better time management. There\\'s time outs, 4 quarters, time stops on a missed pass or an injury, as opposed to soccer, where time never stops, and the refs just add some random amount of time to the clock when the half is over.\\n\\n* There\\'s more variety. Like I said, different plays, different skill sets for different players, touchdowns, field goals, passing, running, punting, etc. In soccer, there\\'s only a \\'goal,\\' which brings me to my next point:\\n\\n* There\\'s so much action! In football, an interception or a completed pass is exciting. In soccer, both of those things seem to happen every 5 - 10 seconds. In football, a game where one team scored once (or zero times) and the other team scored two or less times, would be a pretty boring game. In soccer, 1-0, 1-1, 2-0, and 2-1 seem to be pretty common scores.\\n\\nSo, please, CMV! I would really love to get more into soccer, because I really enjoyed getting into football this last season. I\\'ve already got my hierarchy of teams I want to win planned out (GO USA! Then Costa Rica! Then Germany! Then Belgium! Then Netherlands!)\\n\\nE: Thanks to everyone for commenting! At this point, all but one of my views have been changed, and I\\'ve bolded that above. \\n\\nThe general take away from this, as far as I can tell is (A) I need to learn more of the rules of soccer, (B) I need to stop trying to watch soccer as if it\\'s football, and instead watch it like it\\'s soccer.\\n\\nThanks again!\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Ordinarily, this would be fine, and I think it is for the most part effective against ordinary criminals who are easily contained. When we consider supervillains, we consistently see that they either break free of capture or avoid getting captured in the first place. These villains often go on to pursue other schemes that result in significant harm or death to innocent civilians. If that's the case, then it would be better for heroes to apply lethal force in order to prevent villains from escaping and endangering more lives. Note that this does not always entail killing. A hero would not be justified in killing a villain if merely handicapping that villain would be equally or more effective at preventing harm. My basic argument boils down to:\\n\\n1. It is justified to use the minimal amount of force necessary to safely prevent a person from infringing on others' rights, provided that the minimal amount is still reasonably proportional to the crime that would be committed (We would permit a John to kill Jack if it was necessary in order to prevent Jack from killing another person, but would not allow John to kill Jack if it were the minimal amount of force necessary to prevent him from stealing $5.)\\n\\n2. Supervillains often commit crimes that result in numerous deaths or at the very least, a significant amount of danger to the lives of innocent people. \\n\\n3. Crimes that result in numerous deaths or at the very least, a significant amount of danger to the lives of innocent people warrant the criminal being killed if necessary.\\n\\n4. Thus, the crimes that supervillains commit warrant them being killed if it is necessary.\\n\\n5. Killing or handicapping a supervillain is the minimal amount of force to subdue them as capture is not an option.\\n\\nC. Killing or handicapping a supervillain is morally permissible; obligatory if you think superheroes have a moral obligation to stop villains.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** Killing or handicapping prevents villains from infringing on others rights better than simple capture does, so superheroes should use those means.\\n\\nExtra note: I bring up killing because for certain varieties of villains, such as psychic villains like Psimon, magic villains like Loki, or smart villains like Lex Luthor cannot have their relevant abilities handicapped without doing something that is probably about as bad as killing them (granted, I don't know enough about superhero universes to know if there are ways to disable these abilities).\\n\\nCMV\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

All these things would be much cheaper if their prices weren\\'t artificially inflated by the unnecessary involvement of insurance companies.\\n\\nHealth insurance should be like all other kinds of insurance: It should only cover costs that are prohibitively expensive, urgently needed, and difficult to predict needing in advance.

And the reason is simple: Birth control is not medicine. It doesn\\'t treat an affliction. Rather, it just helps women manage their risk of pregnancy. But there are other ways to do that - condoms, pulling out, avoiding sex for the few days around ovulation (or entirely). I understand that its deeply important to women to avoid unwanted pregnancies, but that doesn\\'t justify extending the concept of \"healthcare\" to birth control.

In general, we recognize that that\\'s the most efficient way for the market to operate.

While this not being as bad as getting a Trojan, if your internet usage is kept relatively simple by mainly visiting places like Reddit and such, many if not all free AV software hit you with a constant barrage of auto-updates, mini scans, and popups for \"discounted offers\" to upgrade that in effect, slow your computer down more than anything.

My view has changed a bit, and I\\'ve awarded a few deltas.  I have to get on with my day, but thanks for all the input.  Anyone who still wants to add more input is welcome to, of course.**\\n\\nThis has been on my mind a long, long time.\\n\\nWe have entered an age where we seek out friends and lovers based on keywords.  We\\'re convinced things will be better if we only spend time with other people who already like the same things we do.  Read the same books, watch the same TV, listen to the same music, display the same politics, and so on and so forth.\\n\\nI think this is at the core of the breakdown oh human co-operation.  All over the world, ideological differences are driving a wider and wider divide between people.  For the first time since the Pilgrims left for the New World, we have millions seeking an \"escape.\"  A common theme I hear from people in my generation and younger is \"I just want to buy a plot of land out in the middle of nowhere **and live my life the way I want to.**\"  To bolster this, over 200,000 people signed up for Mars One, a project that might not even be a reality, but it shows just how many people are ready and willing to bail on the human race on planet earth, just as the Puritans were ready to bail on Catholicism.\\n\\nThere is nothing necessarily wrong with getting along with people who have the same interests as you, and it is not as though I haven\\'t seen the positive aspects of this in my lifetime.  Yes, the gay community was able to use the internet to facilitate finding each other more easily and thus were able to gain more traction and make their minority voice heard.  However, if the recent fight between transgender people and the gay community over the word \"tranny\" says anything, its that even when you\\'re a minority, you\\'re just as willing to absolutely reject people who are different than you and not worry about how your actions hurt them.\\n\\nMy point simply being:  I see the positives the internet has brought us.  I love the internet.  However, I\\'m not willing to sit here and watch humanity flush itself down the toilet because absolutely *nobody* is willing to have a rational conversation with people with different views.  (Barring except, of course, this small subreddit, which is very much a niche online.  We barely have enough people here to fill a small city.  We\\'re in the glaring minority.)\\n\\nIn the US, the political discourse is falling into complete disarray as more new ideologies (Tea Party) spring up, and they have *zero intention* of having intelligent discourse.  They have every intention to attempt to destroy the status quo and replace it with their vision.  ISIS in Iraq is just as guilty of this, as well.  The internet facilitates this by partnering us with people who already have the same ideas as we do already.\\n\\nI struggle with this as a liberal who thinks I can\\'t reject conservative thinkers because I see great points and philosophy on both sides of the aisle.  I feel like people on both sides of the fence are willing to reject evidence against their cause simply because they don\\'t like it.  Then they talk amongst themselves to bolster more support.  They start downvote/upvote brigades.  I don\\'t know a single political philosophy that isn\\'t guilty of this, shoving their opinion down people\\'s throats instead of having a nuanced, thoughtful discussion which is willing to take critique of their views.  (Seriously, I may be a liberal, but god damn are liberals *just as bad as conservatives.*  Don\\'t let anyone tell you different.  It\\'s bullshit and they know it.)\\n\\nI know the internet has brought us so many positive things in the modern world, but it has taught us to seek out people to be involved with in our lives based on criteria that we dictate.  A few decades ago, we would have to learn **good social skills to be able to connect with people who weren\\'t exactly like us.**  Does that mean we had to agree with them on every issue?  No.  Does that mean there weren\\'t still people who were total assholes?  No.  What it does mean, though, is that we have severely limited ourselves and our social ability to communicate effectively with people we might not agree with on every issue.  I think this is part of the cause of why we\\'ve seen the rise of extremism of every stripe and why people simply don\\'t get along and just want to \"move to the country and be left alone.\"\\n\\nTL;DR: \"Knowing your audience\" or being able to communicate effectively with people who have different ideals is a **learned social skill.** Through applications that let us find people who already agree with us, we are teaching the opposite of that social skill.\\n\\nChange my view.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Africa also has the highest expected long-term population growth.  If Africa was annihilated, it could be colonized by countries like China and India, therefore alleviating their overpopulation.\\n\\n2. Africans generally live marginal existences. Africa has the lowest standards of living on earth, and has a plethora of war, famine, and disease.  Causing them to all instantly die would put them out of their misery.\\n\\n3. Some may argue that Africa should not be annihilated because killing is wrong. This is a short-sighted view.  If killing is wrong, annihilating Africa would reduce killing long-term.  The amount of people being killed in wars, famines, and plagues would plummet. Killing would ultimately be prevented, by preventing people from being born.\\n\\n4. The amount of suffering caused by killing is not proportional to the number of people killed. If a random person is murdered, their friends and relatives will become saddened because of it. If all Africans die, the amount of suffering produced will not be that multiplied by a billion. Take a random African in a random village.

There is real disillusionment in that moment when you first learn that Santa\\'s not real, and there\\'s a real feeling that you\\'ve been lied to, because - well - you have been lied to all your life by the very people you should trust the most.

The kind of person who commands $300,000 probably brings a marginal benefit worth much more than $250,000 over the kind of person who commands $50,000. From this point of view it only makes sense that the charities invest in a highly paid executive, figuring that they gain more than they lose by spending the extra money.\\n\\nOf course, this is a different matter from people who embezzle money from charities, and if you give the charity the benefit of the doubt, they don\\'t spend $300,000 a year on $50,000 a year talent except by mistake.\\n\\nTo conclude I\\'d like to counter one probable argument, which is that the talented, dedicated people who can get a large salary from a charity should be willing to forego that large salary for the good of the cause.

It seems like women pretty much only care about how hot a guy is based on what Hollywood deams to be what the ideal hot guy is (from movies, magazines, etc), and that\\'s exactly what the women chase above all else, to the complete exclusion of others. What I mean by this, is that most of these women will not give a guy a chance if you don\\'t pass their extremely high bar of physical attractiveness standard, even if they themselves are only average on the bell curve of attractiveness. This goes for chance meetings (for example trying to start a casual conversation at a coffee house), meat markets (clubs, bars, online dating), and social gatherings with friends. Pretty much all the ways that people normally meet people of romantic interests.\\n\\nWhat am I basing my view on? The following:\\n\\n1. Personal experience when I was single.\\n\\n2.

He admitted to being an armed guard at Auschwitz, and allegedly he was also a volunteer and member of the SS. Each count is linked to a trainload of victims brought to the death camp while he worked there.\\n\\nI do not know whether this particular man is guilty, nor his current political beliefs. However I maintain that even if he has been a Nazi sympathizer his whole life, even if he has no regrets about his past, and even if he was a willing participant in all those murders, he should not be arrested for this crime.\\n\\nThe man in question was 20 years old when Auschwitz was liberated, and only 19 at the time of the crimes cited by the German warrant. He had volunteered at the age of 17. I\\'m sure no one here was complicit in genocide at that age, but nonetheless we all made mistakes when we were younger. The difference is Breyer lived in a time when the potential impact of youthful mistakes was much greater. The Nazi regime deliberately appropriated the folly of youth for its own means, and even the most ideological 20 year olds were simply pawns in the Holocaust.\\n\\nStatutes of limitations are generally accepted as an important element of modern justice. While there may not be a legal limit when it comes to crimes like murder, I believe there should be. I don\\'t know what the cutoff point should be, but surely 70 years is too much. 70 years ago is history, and as any historian will tell you [we cannot judge the actions and beliefs of remote historical periods based on modern standards.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(literary_and_historical_analysis)) Maybe we can judge political leaders, but not everyday citizens.\\n\\nThe fact is death camps were legal in Nazi Germany. The actions committed there were legally sanctioned violence. There are plenty of examples of otherwise criminal actions legally permitted in modern society. For example, what if 20 years from now we decided to prosecute anyone who contributed to global warming? We might be justified in blaming political leaders who set policies that allowed corporations to pollute, and we might even be justified in blaming corporate executives who destroyed our environment for their own gain, but could we prosecute a factory worker?\\n\\nBreyer was 9 years old when Hitler came to power. He was 14 when WWII officially began. It is simply impossible to judge someone raised in that environment using modern liberal democratic standards. The Nazi regime was designed to brainwash children into total loyalty and enthusiastic support for its evil ideals. Maybe we can judge people who were older and wiser, but a child raised in the Third Reich deserves leniency.\\n\\nThe most important question in my mind is: what does anyone gain by prosecuting Johann Breyer? Yes some of his victims are still alive, and of course it is difficult to assign any benefit to a murder trial since the real victims cannot receive any recompense for their suffering. However, a death sentence would be excessive and life in prison relatively meaningless for such an old man. It seems obvious that the real function of a trial like this is to reduce German society\\'s guilt to a single individual and punish him in order to lighten its own conscience. Breyer was not a politician or other public figure, he was a worker. The only reason to target Breyer is because he coincidentally is one of the last Nazi criminals left alive - if Hitler was still alive to be prosecuted, Breyer would never have been arrested.\\n\\nI personally believe in modern German collective guilt. It is healthy for a whole country to recognize and regret its past, regardless of whether individuals were participants or even alive at the time. In the same way, English people have to atone for 19th century colonialism and Americans should express remorse for the genocide of Native Americans (in fact this has not been emphasized enough, but that\\'s a discussion for another time). However, these are historical facts for which no single individual can be held to account. If a living individual could be blamed, it would only detract from the necessary collective guilt. Society needs to learn from its mistakes, not externalize its guilt onto a single person.\\n\\nWas Breyer \"only following orders\" as many Nazis claimed? Even if he was following orders, does that make his crimes any less? I don\\'t know the answers to these questions, but I believe that they are questions for historians and philosophers rather than lawyers and judges.\\n\\n*TLDR:* Regardless of his actual guilt, Auschwitz guard Johann Breyer should not have been arrested because:\\n* He was the product of an evil society that brainwashed his generation\\n* At the time of his crimes he was barely old enough to be considered a legal adult, and minors are less culpable than adults\\n* All crimes should have a statute of limitations\\n* His crimes should be judged in a different historical context, because they were part of a different society\\n* His prosecution is only a way for modern society to feel better about itself by punishing an arbitrary individual\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

To elucidate my point, there is a map by a reporter named Colin Woodward that expresses the kind of cultural and political divisions I’m talking about: (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2013/11/08/which-of-the-11-american-nations-do-you-live-in/). It would be very helpful to at least look at the maps on the link before responding.\\n\\nI believe that it would be ideal that these U.S. “Nations” or culturally independent regions, in fact become independent and form their own independent governments. I feel this would benefit their populations in the following ways: \\n\\n1. It would allow for these governments to address individual problems more effectively, as the problems effecting each region are quite different. The inference being that the population of a cultural group knows best how to address those problems. \\n\\n2. It would foster more effective democracies since the will of the people to enact their own legislation would not be bogged down in the wash of so many other groups interest (as the situation currently is in D.C.). Since legislation would be more easily passed, it would give people the empowering feeling brought about by self-determination, and make the populations of these regions ultimately happier.\\n\\n3. If those countries continued to have governments with representatives, it would be easier to effect the political process since (considering reductions of scale) talking to your local, or state representative would have a more powerful impact on the laws actually passed.\\n\\nNow, let me consider objections that I anticipate:\\n\\n1. For those of you that say that for some of these regions there is a history of human rights or social justice problems that are only properly addressed by a larger central government, I don’t entirely disagree with you, and I won’t say that you’re wrong or that no intervention is necessary by the “more socially enlightened” cultural group. What I will say is that the situation is analogous to  (although in a slightly less extreme way than) the U.S. interfering in the affairs of other countries (like, for instance, Pakistan). It seems like the solutions that work to problems like these in the current global situation are diplomacy or sanctions, not domination… especially considering that the kinds of human rights problems that would arise if the U.S. split up today, pale in comparison to many of the human rights issues faced in other countries that we would never consider (nor should we consider) invading. Again, because we have seen that when we invade the country of a different cultural group and try to impose our own cultural regime, it often has unforeseen consequences that members of the foreign cultural group are vlid to by virtue of their foreignness. The different cultural groups within the United States are more similar, but still different enough for this problem to still arise, albeit to a lesser degree.\\n\\n2. For those of you that say a solution like this is impractical to implement given the current infrastructure of the country: this is a valid objection, but for the purposes of this discussion I’d like to talk about what the ideal situation would be, not the nitty gritty of how it would be implemented bureaucratically or technically. To CMV, you should tell me why this would not be the ideal situation should we be able to implement it successfully.\\n\\n3. For those of you that say that creating new borders would cause a burden for travel and commerce given the creation of new international borders: I can easily travel to another country now, if I have a passport. And, boarders have not posed much of an economic problem for current international companies that have aspects of their production and distribution processes scattered all over the globe. There may be a problem when it comes to moving to another state (which would turn into immigration), but I don’t see this as a major issue. Again, issues such as immigration are one of the things that these individual cultural cohorts should be able to self-determine.\\n\\n4. For those of you that say “The south already tried that and it didn’t work out so well...” I will say again that to CMV, you should not tell me why it’s impractical to implement given the current infrastructure of the country. I’m only interested in why this would not be the ideal situation should we be able to implement it successfully.\\n\\nThat being said, please CMV!\\n\\n[Edit]: I've never done a CMV before, and my inbox is full of very thoughtful responses that I want to read and digest before I respond. Just letting you guys know I'm not ignoring you if I don't respond very fast :)\\n\\n[Edit]: I have to get back to work, but I'll be back a little later this evening... I want to keep talking about this ( /u/grunt08, you're getting very close to your next delta...)\\n\\n[Edit]: I gave a delta to /u/grunt08. Here is my response to him:\\n\\nΔ\\n\\n&gt; So you perceive a problem (electoral inefficacy) which has a solution (electoral reform) but you mistakenly conclude that the best way to achieve that solution is to split the country arbitrarily by region.\\n\\nThis is exactly what I was doing. The problem is not necessarily that the country is too big, but that the current electoral system does not do a very good job of adequately representing the will of the people (and therefore, in my mind, violates the basic social contract that the government gets it's authority to legislate by the consent of the governed). But it does not follow from that that the solution is to break up the country. It would be more reasonable to advocate for electoral reform. How to do that or whether that is practical is another question for another thread. My V is C'd, congrats! \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Please read edit.**\\n\\nFirst and foremost I want to define “felon” as someone who has actually committed a felony. I don\\'t want this conversation to become about the failings of the justice system. For the purposes of this CMV, I just want to be clear that we are debating whether or not people who have been removed from society for committing heinous crimes should be granted the right to vote.\\n\\nMy argument is really quite simple. We have removed these people from society specifically because they have committed crimes that are highly destructive of society in general. I hope we can generally all agree that people who destroy lives and threaten society should not be allowed to live among those of us who obey the law and contribute positively to society.\\n\\nIf these men and women are so dangerous that they must be kept separate from the rest of society, then how does it follow that they should still be allowed to contribute in one of the most important functions of society (voting)? \\n\\nTo keep it simple, I\\'m not going to cite an in-depth analysis of the occurrence of mental illness in inmates. The Hare Psychopathy Checklist rates 80-85% of criminals as having Antisocial Personality Disorder. This is a diagnosis that falls just below all-out psychopathy— a diagnosis that 20% of prison inmates carry. From Wikipedia: “Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others.” Also from Wiki, “Psychopathy is traditionally defined as a personality disorder  characterized by enduring antisocial behavior, diminished  empathy and remorse, and disinhibited or bold behavior.\"  \\n\\nIt seems outrageous to me that people who have no regard for the rights of others should be allowed direct involvement in a practice that affects laws and policy. If we can agree that laws are based on commonly accepted standards of morality and that morality is based on empathy, then people who have proven their lack of empathy through their own criminality should— almost by definition— not be given the right to vote. \\n\\n**EDIT: Thank you for the feedback. After a few comments, my view has been changed slightly. My revised position is that criminals who test positive for ASPD or psychopathy should not have the right to vote. Since my view has been changed, there is no longer a need to continue debating unless you feel inclined to challenge my revised position.

My mother took my siblings and I out only on Saturdays for fun. She would save up her money and take us downtown to the local mall for a treat and maybe a toy. We didn\\'t have much and lived on the third floor of an apartment that we later learned was the local drug house. Even though for us going out for a meal was extremely rare, she instilled in us that you were supposed to tip when you got good service. She told us that you never go out to eat if you couldn\\'t tip; you went to McDonalds or Burger King. She taught us that the people serving you are to be respected for doing their job as it often isn\\'t pleasant. For us, there was no \"running\" a server or just being overly difficult for no reason. Go in, eat your meal, be respectful and tip for good service. Today I am an adult and it pains me to hear that so many black people either don\\'t understand tipping or simply choose not to. So I feel obligated to make up for them by massively over tipping I guess.

To the extent that I think it\\'s wrong to do so, rather than just that it\\'s okay to do so. I believe that society benefits more if these would-be philanthropic companies were to avoid the cost of supporting orphanages etc. and passed the savings on to their customers. Ultimately it is consumers who are in the best position to decide how to use that saved money to benefit society, whether that is through just keeping the savings for themselves (charity starts at home) or through direct donations to the orphanage. Because maybe I\\'d prefer to donate to the EFF than to an orphanage, because I think that actually helps fix problems rather than just treating symptoms. But all the \"socially responsible\" companies adopt an orphanage, because that\\'s the sexy social problem. It makes for good photo opportunities and easy, appeal-to-emotion \"look what awesome people we are\" ad copy.\\n\\nPlease not that I\\'m interested here only in \"social responsibility\" that isn\\'t just an externality to the company\\'s business. Coal-burning power utilities absolutely should have a social responsibility to clean up after themselves. Maybe it isn\\'t (yet?) possible to take CO2 back out of the atmosphere, but they could fund CO2 scrubber research, or better/cheaper solar cells maybe.\\n\\nIn cases where a company can\\'t directly clean up after itself in the externalities it imposes on society, I believe that taxation is the appropriate tool, not self-directed, self-imposed charity. (Which is odd for me to believe, because I don\\'t see myself as much of a \"statist\".)\\n\\nEDIT: Because apparently many people read \"should not\" as \"I want it to be illegal\".

I grew up in a particular country in Southeast Asia known for its issues with racism, and if anyone has ever lived in Asia they\\'d know that if Asians and rednecks have one thing in common, it\\'s their ridiculously racist mindsets. Obviously, this is a sweeping generalization that you should not take to heart. I\\'ve met some really nice rednecks living here in Texas, and I\\'m Asian myself. As such, I grew up among a lot of intolerance and racial/religious/whateverthefuck prejudice. It is through this that I realized most if not all the issues I faced were simply due to intolerance. Most kids just followed their parents\\' outlook of life without thinking about it for themselves. I\\'ve faced parents who disapproved a girl I was dating, and have faced disapproval from the parents of a girl I was romantically involved with, simply because her sister didn\\'t like me and to this day I have no idea why. I\\'ve seen people get angry after finding out that a person they knew was gay. I know people who have been disowned by their parents because of school/relationship/religious issues. I\\'ve faced bullying due to my ethnicity. I have friends who have been in trouble with the law throughout their lives but are some of the most trustworthy people I know.\\n\\nAs such I\\'ve lived most of my life since my early teenage years with a \"live and let live\" and \"mind your own business\" philosophy. I don\\'t know most of my friends\\' religious/political backgrounds until I get to know them really well(still don\\'t know some of my best friends\\' political views), and it\\'s not something I ever discuss with people.  I know of a couple men and women who are cheating on their SOs but I will not interfere because I don\\'t know both parties well. Now obviously some of you will say this breaks the \"as long as no one is being harmed\" philosophy of it, but personally if it\\'s not someone who affects my life, I feel there is no reason for me to interfere in their business. I don\\'t see a valid reason for wasting my time on someone else\\'s problems without a guaranteed good outcome. I\\'ve confronted a family member who was mistreating his kids but I wouldn\\'t have done the same if he was simply cheating on his wife. I don\\'t know any individual\\'s SO any better than they do. For all I know my cheating friends are trying to get away from abusive SOs and finding happiness in someone else.\\n\\nSo CMV, I\\'d like some constructive criticism of my ideology.

This manifests itself differently in each country. For example, in France, leftist economists such as Piketty will be far more successful in academia. In all regions, the subject matter is often dangerously unscientific. Even semi-scientific disciplines such as linguistics are marred by ideologic cancer.\\n\\n2) **Some subjects are intellectually worthless and/or bullshit factories.**\\nThe [Sokal hoax](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair) is a good example of this. Basically, nothing of cultural or practical value is produced. Sadly, philosophy often falls victim to sterile debates of this sort (are humans animals? What is art?)\\nThe intellectual purity of mathematics and physics cannot be surpassed.\\n\\n3) **Many problems outlined by philosophy can only be solved by modern science.**\\nNeurologists, empiricists, inventors can give actual solutions instead of spending their time making assumptions or formulating unverifiable hypotheses. There is no potential limit to what science can accomplish. It\\'s entirely possible that conundrums such as free will can and will be solved soon. There is nothing a philosopher can do that a scientist can\\'t. In fact, the best philosophers tend to be scientists. Science is the only thing that has reliably brought solutions thus far. Even things such as large-scale democracy are only the result of increased wealth caused by tech. The only long term changes brought upon humanity were the result of tech.\\n\\n4) **The best students gravitate towards STEM**\\nThe humanities tend to attract bad students because the subjects are much easier and more open to interpretation, whereas in science rigor and hard work cannot be escaped. I remember back in high school that the best science students were also the best at humanities. They had the most vocabulary and the most extensive cultural knowledge, the best analytical skills and the best taste.\\nThere are way too many mediocre students in the humanities who end up never creating anything of value. That\\'s why humanities in college are a joke.\\n\\n5) **People good at the humanities don\\'t need to study them.**\\nWithout art, culture etc. life wouldn\\'t be worth living. A world with only engineers would be a nightmare. However you\\'d have to be naive to think that studiying humanities in college makes you talented. Great writers don\\'t emerge because of shitty creative writing classes in college or english lit. Great painters don\\'t need art history. Great thinkers manage on their own. Their talent is far beyond what can be taught in school. The production of culture is rarely the result of punctilious study.\\n\\nSo far these are the conlusions I\\'ve come to. Obviously being in STEM does not make you a genius, but the basic point is that a humanities degree is much more likely to be worthless, both practically and intellectually. It\\'s more likely that a given student gravitated towards humanities out of laziness instead of interest. Culture is amazing but is almost never the result of traditional humanities teaching.\\n\\nTL;DR I\\'m bitter about my educational choices\\n\\nThanks for reading.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In the case of attractive men and women who are of age, you could argue that wanting to mate with them or improve social status, but even when this is unlikely or impossible (one party is married - don't snicker) the preferential treatment continues. Is it because they are pleasing to look at? Why does that matter so much? \\n\\nHere I would place an attempt to rebut a counterargument but I can't even begin to think of one, which is why I made this post.

Wii and of course Wiifit, you\\'ll see a trend: These are all games that were either created FOR casual players, or very casual entries in an existing series. \\n\\nFor instance, Mario Kart Wii is easily less difficult than Double Dash, and certainly less than Mario Kart DS. Yet, when you compare the units sold with DS hitting 23.56 million versus the Wii version which sold 35.53 million, it\\'s clear who the winner here is. \\n\\nSo, one thing is clear here: Nintendo has managed to tap into the far larger, pick-up-and-play casual gamer market. This is their major audience, currently, and it\\'s earned them a large amount of money. \\n\\nNow, much of the hate being directed towards Smash 4 is that it\\'s not \"competitive\" enough. Combos are hard/impossible to link, the physics are too slow and there\\'s no L-cancelling, wavedashing or other related high-level techniques that can be used. However, Nintendo\\'s current market is CASUAL, not COMPETITIVE. \\n\\nWe\\'ve already seen through the Gamecube to Wii transition that many, MANY more games are sold when they\\'re catered towards the casual, not competitive, market. Furthermore, entries in a series that get simplified and made easier for casual players (Ex: Brawl, Mario Kart Wii) frankly just sell more. \\n\\nSo, from a business standpoint, why should Nintendo listen to all these naysayers? And why should the company care at all that a group of people who ultimately represent a tiny fraction of their current playerbase dislike the direction that the games are going, when the majority of the players don\\'t care? \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I think having both \"ER\" and \"Ambulance\" type services for mental health would be extremely beneficial in these scenarios because they can provide care when it is most needed.\\n\\nI believe that having these facilities available would give people suffering from mental health issues a resource when they feel like they don\\'t have anyone who can help them.

For high school exams, memorizing specific dates, names, functions etc. are fairly pointless when you could look it up in 5 seconds. Even in university, when writing essays becomes common, producing an analysis of passages in such a short time and stressful environment is not an indication many times of how much one knows, but often how much they have memorized what is mentioned in class. In particular, computer science exams, consisting of writing programs with no aid, is extremely ineffective and does not examine how much one actually knows of a subject.\\n\\nI believe a much better assessment would be through the use of final assignments, where students have a larger time in a less stressful environment. This allows access to all resources they would have in a job, and allows for teachers to provide them with much more difficult and interesting problems than could be provided on a short exam. While it is true that there would be the tendency to copy other students, such students likely will not make it into the job world simply relying on others. If anything, with less stress placed upon a single exam, there would not be the same pressure gradewise.\\n\\nChange my view. \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Criminals permeate every level of society, business and politics and manipulate it all for their benefit. Even the police force is filled with nothing but self-serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way. Jim Gordon is constantly touted as the only good cop - *the only good cop* - in a city wide department. Mobsters and petty criminals walk freely without fear of retribution due to the corruption.\\n\\nThere was hope when it came to their political and criminal saviour, Harvey Dent.

No matter how the forces of Gotham try and take them down, they end up causing more trouble and more havoc.\\n\\nThe people of Gotham are also apathetic to any of these issues. When Gotham is taken over by Bane they turn on each other, ransacking higher end properties and throwing people out on the street. When the city is under a bomb threat they curse their neighbours for the escape to safety before them; unlike Metropolis where, faced with a hugely destructive machine, people stayed behind to help save their fellow man.\\n\\nGotham citizens are as selfish as criminals above them, and given half the opportunity they would succumb to corruption themselves.\\n\\nBut not only is Gotham full of criminals, apathy or ignorance, but it's also constantly threatened by people wishing to destroy it. Shady organisations, activists, you name it, all want Gotham destroyed. With such an outside influence constantly barraging the city, I don't think it's possible to keep its defences.\\n\\nHowever, I do agree that the city has its hopeful points. There are many charitable organisations to help children (such as the Thomas and Martha Wayne Foundation) and there is this strange Batman that's trying to sort out the city, but I don't believe that's enough.

I'm not talking about paparazzi, which in my opinion is closer to stalking or harassment. I'm also not referring to government surveillance, which can involve tracking or data collection beyond a simple photograph or video recording. I'm specifically talking about a scenario like this:\\n\\nPerson A is walking in a public park with lots of people around. Person B is sitting on a park bench. Person A sees a bird in a tree he/she would like to photograph. This tree is directly behind the park bench person B is sitting on. Person A raises the camera to photograph the bird, at which point person B objects to having their photo taken, rather than simply obscuring their face or moving. \\n\\nNow I understand that it may make people uncomfortable knowing that they are the subject being captured on film, but if you are willingly in a public place with many people around, I feel that it's understood that many pictures may be taken, and that you may be in some of them. The idea that a photographer needs to ask permission from everyone that may be in any given picture is absurd. I say this from personal experience, as well as other examples from around the web, a good one being [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/27m68v/crazed_woman_attacks_man_for_flying_drone_on_beach/).\\n\\nThis woman chose to go to a public place, and was then offended when someone else at the public place had a camera. Never mind the assault charges, I believe she had no right to confront the person about it.\\n\\nEssentially it boils down to a person attempting to deprive someone of the ability to photograph and observe freely simply because they are indirectly affected with no real harm done. Being photographed does not damage a person in any way, other than possibly making them uncomfortable for a few minutes. It's similar in a way to being offended at an interracial or gay couple in a public place in my mind; just because you don't like it doesn't mean everyone else has to change their behavior for you. \\n\\nBut maybe I'm missing something, so Reddit feel free to CMV!\\n\\nEdit: To clear something up, take [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_11Ys6wmW_BM/TFI_ke9pcgI/AAAAAAAABJI/xd3AQxUMCSc/s1600/Cinematheque+Flashmob-1.jpg) as an example that I used in the comments below. The subjects here are the dancers. Should the photographer have gotten the permission of everyone in the background before taking this photo? Doesn't that seem a bit absurd considering this is a public shopping mall, and it would be nearly impossible to get permission from all those people AND still take the photo he/she wanted?\\n\\nEdit 2: I believe my title is misleading. It should have read, you have no rational *reason* to object. I'll award deltas due to this error on my part.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

If we start with the assumptions that there are no greater beings which dictate the purpose of life or human existence, and that the most powerful paradigm is the one which provides the most personal happiness while minimizing contradictions, then it seems that a complete amorality is the strongest secular position. I'll use a simple example to explain why I think so:\\n  \\nA man is faced with the choice: whether or not to gain $1,000,000 and bring about the instant death of a random person he does not know. A moral man would be at a serious dilemma. He must choose between what he believes to be right (protecting human life) and his selfish desires (to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.) The man must sacrifice either his own happiness or his moral principle at this juncture. An amoral man would not be at a loss; he would not think twice about taking the money and would overall be happier with himself for doing so than the moral man.\\n  \\nThese points of cognitive dissonance are a serious hindrance to an individual's happiness. No one likes the feeling of choosing between one good thing and another. The person would prefer, whether he knows it or not, to receive one without knowledge of the other. Barry Schwartz talked about this in his book The Paradox of Choice. In the same respect, an amoral man is happier with his life and his decisions than a moral man, who frets over the best way to go about doing things and must worry about both his own selfish interests and his moral principles. \\n  \\nI have come to believe this wholeheartedly, but it seems to contradict with almost everyone's point of view, and I'm not confident enough to assume I'm right and (seemingly) the world is wrong. I don't ruthlessly pursue my own interests and in fact, many people would consider me a good person. I often enjoy helping people I respect and care for, even at great cost to myself, and my circumstances allow me to live more comfortably within the bounds of the law than I would if I were to become a criminal. However, I don't hold any moral principles. My only principle is to maximize my own enjoyment of life, and if someone were to offer me the hypothetical $1,000,000 briefcase, without fear of the legal consequences, I would probably take 1,000 and sleep like a baby afterwards. I don't see how adding morality to the equation of human existence provides more happiness for the individual; to me, it seems to lead to contradiction. A person's beliefs should serve him or her, not the other way around.\\n  \\nEdit: Formatting\\n\\n__________\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

After the struggle of the whole book it is nice that the protagonist we have grown attached to has eventually found peace and is no longer scared.\\n\\nI understand why some people find it depressing, as The Party aren't overthrown and the totalitarians that oppress the people win. But it was foolish to think that Winston could have really changed the situation, and in his circumstance it is surely better to follow The Party and be happy than struggle towards an unreachable goal and be depressed.\\n\\nIgnorance is strength CMV.\\n\\nEdit: I'm surprised and happy with the amount of discussion this has brought about.

On top of that, you have to deal with constant stress and possible violence from other inmates leaving you with emotional and perhaps physical scars. Once you do get out, you\\'re lost. You have no housing, transportation, insurance, etc. More so, technology has probably advanced so much you don\\'t know how anything works anymore. Often you can\\'t even get decent work due to a lack of skills and/or discrimination. Sometimes your criminal record isn\\'t even erased! Basically your life is ruined and you\\'re wasting more of your life just catching up on everything you missed. \\n\\nRegardless of why someone was wrongfully convicted, every state should be providing considerable support. Of course you can sue the state afterwards, but that\\'s more time and a lot of hassle to ask someone who just gave up a big chunk of their life for nothing and needs money immediately. Even then nothing is guaranteed. Every state needs to automatically compensate these people with a very large amount of money for every year spent in prison **immediately** when they are proved innocent and freed. I know some states provide up to $50,000 per year of imprisonment but even that seems way too little when you could have had an established career and (depending on the person) likely be earning $100,000+ with other benefits and opportunities just by being free.\\n\\nStates should be providing considerably more money than that earned through a job while free for a couple of reasons\\n\\n1) Being in prison can be considered a 24/7 job, that\\'s 280 hours/week vs the standard 40 hours/week\\n\\n2) When you\\'re free, you\\'re spending even more time getting adjusted and back on your feet. When you do get a job, the pay is usually not much due to the lack of skills/established career\\n\\n3) If I spent decades in prison, I wouldn\\'t want to be a slave again working to support myself. Rather I would want money to travel, be free, and enjoy life to make up for all the years that was robbed from me\\n\\nCommon arguments and my response (parts copied from my other post)\\n\\n1) This has only become an issue recently with the rise of DNA testing and the justice system is slow to change\\n\\nIgnoring DNA testing for a second, people been found innocent once people uncover evidence that the prosecution had purposefully hidden during court trials? I don\\'t know too much about this as far as rates and statistics go, but I could imagine that this has happened ever since our modern justice system was formed.\\n\\nEven if it\\'s slow to change, that no excuse to destroying lives and leaving them with nothing since it is incredibly unfair.\\n\\n2) States just don\\'t have the money to give to all the wrongly convicted.\\n\\nIf I spent a lot of time in jail when I repeatedly claimed I was innocent (or everyone agrees that I was forced into a wrongful confession), that isn\\'t fair to me especially when the justice system is built around fairness. The money issue is the state\\'s problem. Remember, it\\'s much much harder to prove innocence when you don\\'t have a strong alibi.  \\n\\nAlso, if this is the case, why is there a double standard? If the state doesn\\'t take responsibility for its wrong doings because it can\\'t afford it why can\\'t I then use the same argument when I do something wrong? For example, if I\\'m poor and I was given a fine due to something like a traffic violation, why can\\'t I just say \"oops, I can\\'t afford it, sorry guys\" without any repercussions. Let\\'s face it, a lot of crimes like traffic violations often happen by mistake. Not always does someone plan to speed or run a stop sign intentionally. Ethically and morally speaking, I personally feel as if it is far far worse for the state to ruin an innocent person\\'s life and then just say sorry without any compensation or support than it is for me not paying a traffic fine. \\n\\nEdit: Just to be clear, my view is that this proposal should only be geared towards people are proven innocent after serving time through new evidence or a reanalysis of past evidence. People who are released simply due to a technicality should not benefit from this, at least not to this extent\\n\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I won't delete it but you are more than welcome to downvote this post to oblivion.\\n\\n***\\n\\nLet me preface this by saying that one of the most common points in these types of posts seems to be that there are a few different types of soldiers, and the national guard and such tend to help people. This isn't about those soldiers. This is about soldiers that kill people.\\n\\nNow, as far as I understand (and if I get something completely wrong, please point me to resources I can read to correct my misconception(s)), most of the time soldiers aren't really sure why they are killing people. So what happens is, an order is given, soldiers get sent out, and they must make a choice: a)shoot people or b)be court marshaled (or c) do their best to make it look like they are contributing whilst racking up as few casualties while staying safe as possible). \\n\\nChoice a) means the soldier values their non-court-marshaled life as being more important than the entirety of the life of the person they are shooting at to kill. If the person they are shooting at has killed one or more other people, it's a less cut and dry question but as far as I understand, the soldier is unaware of the killcount of the person they shoot at. It is therefore difficult, if not impossible, for the soldier to act in a moral fashion consistently. Soldiers may or may not act morally even if given the choice, but that's a different issue: here, it seems, they are not even given the choice.\\n\\nOutside of refusing to go to dangerous areas and being court marshaled for it, c) seems like the most moral choice to make but I feel like soldiers shouldn't have to do that--they should be debriefed on the latest intelligence on how many people everyone (or as many people as possible) they encounter have killed before going on a mission and be given strict orders to use non-lethal methods when dealing with everyone else. If this becomes impossible to do while staying safe, the mission should be aborted and re-planned. Commanders who mislead their troops should face some kind of punishment.\\n\\nSo the TL;DR is that soldiers are people, and people killing people who haven't killed others (or have been a direct cause of the death of others) or are unaware of whether the person they shoot at has killed other or not, is immoral and should not be done.\\n\\nCMV.\\n\\n\", 'op-title': 'CMV: The current structure of the military, where soldiers are unaware of why people deserve being fired upon, is morally indefensible.', 'pair_ids': ['p_1100'], 'train': 1})}),\n",

I love you guys.\\n\\nAs always there\\'s a couple threads about gender issues floating around and I saw a particular comment in which someone felt that it was rape if a woman was \"blackout drunk\" and a man has sex with her. The definition of blackout drunk in context, and the definition I\\'m familiar with, implied that she would wake up the following day with little or no memory of having sex, not that she was unconscious. Hell, I once saw a girl who was blackout drunk sit down at the top of some stairs at a party and start masturbating until someone came to give her the attention she was looking for. Was that dude a rapist because they\\'d never met before and she was drunk? She definitely regretted it the next day. My opinion: I don\\'t think it\\'s rape and I don\\'t feel that way as someone that\\'s never been in this situation because, if it is, I have by this definition been raped. I\\'ll share a brief story:\\n\\nThere was this girl in college. She had a less than desirable personality and, I\\'m going to be blunt here, was extremely unattractive and unhygienic. On no day that I am sober or even slightly intoxicated would I willingly consent to having sex with her. While I was nicer to her when she offered, I had declined several times. We did have a few friends in common, though, and one night she hits me up and tells me that her and our friends are going out to a club. She offers to pick me up, I accept. We get to the club and, go figure, none of our friends are there. I go ahead and start drinking as I\\'ve been reassured that they\\'re on their way, just running late. Long story short our friends never show up and I, knowing that I don\\'t have to drive home and she isn\\'t drinking all that much, decide to go ahead and drink my fill. I don\\'t remember much about getting home and the deeds that happened there, but I do know this much: she knew that I was drunk as hell, she knew that I would not otherwise willingly consent to sleeping with her, and we fucked.\\n\\nAgain, I\\'d like to state that no matter how much regret I may have had the following morning I don\\'t feel like I was raped. Was it a bit shady? Maybe, but I feel like I\\'m the one to blame for what happened because I irresponsibly got myself to a point where I made a bad decision or, best case scenario, let someone make a bad decision for me. Would I have done the same as she did? I know you have to be wondering and the answer is that even in this *same* situation with reversed roles I have never, nor would ever. I\\'ll almost never sleep with someone, especially not the first time, if there has been heavy drinking. For clarification: the only reason I say \"almost\" because one of my exes was a drinker and we were always pretty wasted when we slept with each other.\\n\\nI should probably point out that I am, as indicated by the title, talking about the *voluntary* consumption of drugs and alcohol. In the above example no one was force-feeding me drinks, no one roofied me, I voluntarily consumed way too much alcohol.\\n\\nIf you get extremely drunk or high on drugs and you murder someone then you are held accountable in spite of how impaired your judgement may have been. If you are extremely high or drunk and you crash your car you are held accountable for your actions. In *any* other legal situation being high or drunk does not grant you any kind of immunity from your actions. If you get extremely drunk or high and sleep with someone you are accountable for your actions.\\n\\nOn top of that I just don\\'t see the consistency. If a girl gets wasted and sleeps with a dude she would not have slept with otherwise is it rape if he\\'s sober but okay if he is also wasted and, therefore, has impaired judgement as well? Some people will say I\\'m victim blaming, and what I\\'m saying is under these circumstances the only thing someone who gets too wasted is a victim to is their own lack of responsibility.\\n\\nCMV.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There are large bananas and small bananas\\n\\n2) The curve. Bananas are not usually straight. This makes judging their length difficult. It can also mean that it is hard to show the banana very close to the object you are scaling against.\\n\\n3) Bananas are relatively small, this makes them bad for judging the scale of larger objects. This is especially bad when considered in conjunction with point 1, as any difference between the percieved size of a banana and the actual size will be enhanced for an object many times the size of the banana. \\n\\n4) Bananas are perishable. This means that it is unreasonable to expect a redditor to have them on hand at all times. I for one do not at present own a banana as being a poor student living alone I cannon afford a fully equiped fruit collection, I only own at most 2 types at a time (at present I own apples and pears). \\n\\n5) Bananas are relatively large. This may conflict with point 3, but the point is that when scaling small objects (pins, hair ect) then a banana is too large, meaning that in order to use one for scale you would either need to show only a small amount of the banana (therefore making it fairly useless for judging scale) or you would need to 'zoom out' in order to show the entire banana thus making the object less visible and therefore harder to judge scale. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But frankly, I don\\'t see the appeal of glass over, say, a regular smartphone like the one I have now. From what I can tell, the smartphone I have is superior to Glass in every way.\\n\\nPRICE\\n\\nFor one, Google Glass is $1,500. Compare that to just $300 for the 32GB Iphone 5s. I understand that it\\'s brand new and the price will eventually come down, but for now, that\\'s way too much.\\n\\nSPECS\\n\\n* 5 Megapixel camera for Glass, compared to 8 Megapixel for the Iphone.\\n* 720p video camera on Glass, compared to 1080p for the Iphone.\\n* 12 GB data storage capacity for Glass, compared to 16, 32, or 64 GB for the Iphone. This doesn\\'t take cloud storage into consideration, though.\\n\\nCONVENIENCE\\n\\nOne of the big things that I hear touted about Glass is convenience over a traditional smartphone, thereby justifying the price. But let\\'s break that down a bit.\\n\\n* I can\\'t play games on Glass very easily, such as Tetris or Angry Birds that I can easily play on my phone with the touch screen. These are games that sort of require a touch screen in order to play effectively.\\n* The voice feature is nice, and is very responsive, but what if I want to send a text to someone and don\\'t want everyone around me to know what I\\'m saying? What if I want to visit a website but not have everyone around me know? I could use the touchpad on the side, but it\\'s not as quick as the keypad on my phone. Even if I got used to it, it\\'s still probably still not as quick.\\n* Glass isn\\'t a phone in and of itself, functioning more like a handsfree device. So this means that I\\'ll have to carry around my regular phone in addition to Glass. So that means yet another device in addition to my phone that I have to charge every night and find a place to keep. But I can\\'t keep it in my pocket like my phone, since it\\'s glasses, and they might get crushed. I don\\'t have a purse. And I\\'m certainly not wearing it clipped to my collar like a tourist because it might fall off my shirt and get smashed. I\\'m not wearing it on top of my head because that will look really stupid and, again, might fall off. So I either have to wear it all the time, or get some loose, big pockets to put it in.\\n\\nSo there goes the whole convenience argument right out the window. I\\'d rather just take two seconds to pull my phone out of my pocket whenever I need to use it than have the \"convenience\" of having it all right in front of my eyeballs all the time but at the cost of not having anything to do with the freaking thing when I\\'m not using it. Also, I\\'ll still have to use my regular phone for many things, and still have to pull it out of my pocket when I need it anyway. \\n\\nWhat else has Glass promised? Browsing through Google\\'s app store, the list of apps available doesn\\'t seem too impressive compared with apps already available on a standard phone. \"Augmented reality?\" So, like, I\\'m walking down the street and see Yelp reviews for all the restaurants appear in front of my eyes? Or see driving directions pop up right in front of me?\\n\\nThat would be great if I ever actually went anywhere, but I\\'ve lived in the same town for years and pretty much know all the good restaurants and know my way around already. I go on a road trip maybe once a year and I just use the GPS in my car. Works great.\\n\\nWhat else? Night vision goggles? Uh, okay, if I ever need to see in the dark and don\\'t happen to have a flashlight or the light on my phone, that\\'ll be great.\\n\\nSo, all you glass enthusiasts out there, please tell me what the appeal is of Google Glass.\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies!

I\\'m against the criminalization of all drugs (but that\\'s a topic for another day). I mean by the way society views it, the way that people look down and consistently discourage things like narcotics, methamphetamines, etc.\\n\\nI\\'m 19 now, and since the drinking age in my country is 18, I\\'ve seen many of my friends over the last couple of years grow into the \"alcohol\" culture that basically the entire world shares. Sometimes this has scared me. Friends that have been with me since I was 12 years old have given me times where I am legitimately scared for my safety because of alcohol, all the while the rest of the group and cheering this person on. I dislike the mere fact that getting drunk for enjoyment is socially accepted and even encouraged.\\n\\nI don\\'t drink, as you\\'ve probably guessed. In fact, I stay as far away from the stuff as I can because I detest the taste, just like I stay as far away from peas as I can...but also because the mere idea of getting drunk scares me. Loosing rational control of myself is not something I would like to experience, especially if it means I could hurt someone.\\n\\nThe fact that I don\\'t drink has been a point of contention for my friends, family and even just strangers I meet. Everyone seems surprised that I don\\'t, and in almost all cases try to get to me to drink, in one case even trying to \\'spike\\' a drink of mine with alcohol just to see me drunk. How is this acceptable behaviour in any circumstance? And yet it is, when it comes to alcohol, because it\\'s seen as \"fixing\" me or making me less of \"a drag from not drinking.\" I\\'ve had to opt out of family events because of this.\\n\\nWhile it may be a specific case in my family, the idea that it\\'s acceptable to do that is the culture around alcohol I just don\\'t understand and almost hate. The fact that society views alcohol as a requirement for \"a good time\" is something I think is incredibly toxic to our lives. I\\'d say a good hefty percentage of things like car accidents, crimes like domestic abuse, fighting, etc. stems from alcohol. While I\\'m all for the \"everything in moderation,\" I think alcohol is something that most people can\\'t keep moderated. \\n\\nWe glorify alcohol, we glorify getting drunk, society works hard to associate it with a good time to the point where most people believe that you can\\'t have a good fun time with your friends without \"getting smashed.\" People look forward to forgetting their weekend! How crazy is that?!\\n\\nNo other drug is glorified this way, not even Marijuana (admittedly getting closer to it these days) which is the probably least \"harmful\" criminalized drug. I don\\'t see why society views just alcohol this way and continues to be adamant for the criminalization on other drugs, even ones with a similar (or less) risk level like Marijuana.\\n\\nOther things have come into our society that operate the same as alcohol culturally, like smoking. At one point, it was all the rage. You were outcast if you didn\\'t smoke, just like now if you don\\'t drink. And then people realised that it was harming us, harming people with second hand smoke. And it\\'s been slowly phased back out. It still exists, but at least in my country, it\\'s something you never talk about, it\\'s something that\\'s looked down upon by most people. People are surprised and sometimes revolted if you mention you smoke, and in \"common society\" it\\'s not something you do to \"hang out\" like drinking. And yet, I consider alcohol more harmful because with the amount of alcohol fuelled crimes and accidents, I believe it\\'s probably done a lot more damage to individuals and indirect people than smoking ever has. \\n\\n**TL;DR:** I think that society should be working to discourage alcohol just like we do with other drugs. It\\'s harmful to the people who drink it, to the people around it, and the glorification it gets in society only serves to promote something I consider inherently bad to people, even ones who wouldn\\'t normally drink. We\\'ve already done this with something like smoking, which has similar self and indirectly other harming properties that was widely glorified. **Please CMV**. I want to understand why people think alcohol is considered acceptable to be in our culture in this way. But please don\\'t try to convince me to drink \"just to try it so I\\'ll see.\" \\n\\nEDIT: I\\'m Australian, if that helps give cultural context. It\\'s been brought up that my views are almost flat out incorrect in other cultures and especially other age groups, which is a very good point.\\n\\n**EDIT2:** I wish to explain my change of view. This has been an absolutely wonderful discussion, and thank you all for posting. Most people have raised the point that my argument only reflects a small majority, a particular culture that only really exists in my age group and even just in my country at times. This is an excellent point, and I\\'ve come to realise that treating alcohol like more harmful hard drugs would just be doing a disservice to the majority who do indeed drink responsibly and are genuine good people. It\\'s still harmful, but so are soda drinks, caffeine, driving in the car normally. No reason to outright discriminate against it.\\n\\nI don\\'t think my original argument is necessarily wrong itself, and I think they\\'re good points against drinking in general and for the greater education on responsible drinking, but my post is clearly heavily stepped in selection bias.\\n\\nMany people have raised the point that alcohol has many benefits too, health wise, but particularly as a social lubricant that encourages much of the social interaction that we humans so desperately crave. In the long run, having alcohol as the one common thing between a lot of people is a great benefit to society, we always have a basis to return to.\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, with volts, they are always clearly defined (a specific battery is labeled with a precise amount of volts, an north-American household is wired on 120 V (Europe is 220 V), etc.) while current is left to be whatever it needs to be after we\\'ve plugged in whatever machine (acting with some resistance)\\n\\n* Dealing with volts makes more sense than with amperes. Amperes are, to me, \"always behind\": In a simple household (in America) the voltage is always 120 V. The amperage continually depends on what kind of device is plugged in (according to Ohm\\'s law, V = RI, the current seems more of a product of the voltage and resistance rather than the voltage being a product of current and resistance)\\n\\n* The base definition of an Ampere is, let\\'s face it, pretty fucked up. For those who don\\'t know, in the SI system you want precise units that can be measured according to fundamental properties of the universe (for example a meter is defined using the speed of light, second is defined using periods of radiation of a cesium atom, etc. with the exception of kilogram but that\\'s another topic)     \\nSo what is the current definition of 1 Ampere? According to Wikipedia, it is \"The constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 m apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2×10−7 newtons per metre of length\" it just seems so stupid to me to have something defined using theoretical/mathematical and physically unreachable concepts. How could you measure 1 Ampere precisely using this definition? By somehow having two infinitely big wires, make them perfectly parallel? And somehow making their circular cross-section negligible? Then you\\'re supposed to measure the force they act on each other and be precise on the order of 10^-7 N/m?   \\nTo me, it would make way more sense to use the volt as a base unit, and make it easier to clearly define 1 Volt as (for exemple) the electromotive force in a conductive wire connection a solution of precise concentration of zinc ions with another solution of precise concentration of copper ions (linked with a saline bridge), you know, an electrochemical battery.\\n\\n* Allow me to compare V=RI to F=ma. You wouldn\\'t define the kilogram as being F/a or \"the force of 1 newton divided by 1 meter per second squared\" and then use the Newton as a base unit. It makes no sense, the meter/kilogram/second units are more natural than the newton unit, just like **the volt is more natural than the ampere.** You use kilogram, meters and seconds as base units and use them to derive the newton along with a bunch of other [derived units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit). So why should we use amperes to derive volts given all I\\'ve said (mostly in point 1 and 2) ? No, you should use the volt unit to derive the ampere unit, not the other way around.  \\n   \\nTo expand on this, I\\'ll use [Faraday\\'s law of induction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction) which makes generating electricity from mechanical motion possible. It basically states that the inducted electromotive force is equal to the derivative of the magnetic flux with respect to time. See how it defines electromotive force (aka source voltage), and not current? It\\'s because current comes from voltage and not the other way around. Volt is a more natural unit than ampere when it comes to electricity and magnetism. \\n\\n**TL;DR** The volt should be the base unit, not ampere. Amperes should be defined using volts, not the other way around like it currently is.\\n\\nI\\'m making this CMV thread to see if I\\'m missing anything, because I feel like I\\'m going against most of the scientific community and it\\'s making me feel a bit like a jerk. I\\'d like to see the other side, and especially why scientists would chose amperes over volts, and give them such an awful base definition as well.  \\nAlso, I kinda wanna see what a purely scientific (with no big social or political implications) CMV thread looks like!\\n\\n_____\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I may buy a Coke, for example, but it is not because I have seen a lot of Coke ads.  I have never watched or listened to an advert, then gone and bought something as a result.  In fact, the advertisements often reinforce themselves negatively on me, meaning that I am so annoyed by the constant yammering from a particular company that I choose not to buy from them on principle.  \\n\\n**There is one caveat**, which is that seeing an ad *once* might be valuable so that I can be aware of a company's existence.  Oftentimes this happens through word of mouth or seeing an actual storefront, but sometimes a commercial does the trick.

If you couldn\\'t consent before you were X years, that\\'s fine, but every person is different. Sadly, when people discus age of consent, they usually forget about that.\\n\\nAlso, it is ageist to believe that age equals maturity.\\n\\n3) Not every adult using their \"age advantage\" to force teenagers to have sex with them. And being over 21 year old doesn\\'t mean you are safe from manipulative or abusive sex partners. \\n\\nHow to deal with those people should be explained in sex ed. classes.\\n\\n4) Different people have different sexual preferences.

(By \"irrational\" I mean \"not founded in the actual state of the real world, but instead based on a gut feeling or faith or whatever\")\\n\\nMen are far more likely to be the victim of violent crime than women are. Men make up the vast majority of assault, battery, and murder victims. There are nearly ten times as many assaults as rapes. If you include \"forced to penetrate someone against your will\" as a form of rape (and don\\'t include prison rape), the odds of a man being raped in a given year are nearly identical to the odds of a woman being raped in that year. Furthermore, rape (the only violent crime where a case can be made for women being more at risk than men) is nearly always committed by someone known to the victim, indoors, in a place known to the victim and assailant (such as a bar, one of their houses, a mutual friend\\'s house, etc). Assault, conversely, takes place mostly outside, committed by strangers.\\n\\nAnd yet, women are consistently more afraid of walking around outside (at night, alone, but also in general) than men are. This makes no sense to me: change my view.\\n\\nThere is also a second, related issue that I am confused by. I see articles written by and linked on Facebook etc by self-professed feminists which strongly encourage this (seemingly irrational) fear. For example: http://kateharding.net/2009/10/08/guest-blogger-starling-schrodinger%E2%80%99s-rapist-or-a-guy%E2%80%99s-guide-to-approaching-strange-women-without-being-maced/\\n\\nThis also makes no sense to me. Women are less at risk of this than men, and being afraid all the time sucks, and since they\\'re less at risk than men this fear serves no useful purpose to them, so all that writing this sort of article does is make women\\'s lives worse. Yet when I say that, I get yelled at and dog piled by the feminists who link these articles, who call me a misogynist, sexist, an uncaring and unfeeling ass, and on and on.\\n\\nThat makes negative sense to me, and has caused me to self-identify as an anti-feminist, because the overwhelming majority of feminist thought I encounter is of the form \"women should hold this harmful irrational belief\" or \"men are evil\" or \"no man has ever suffered\". A slight exaggeration, but only slight (sometimes they make very legitimate points about economics). This seeming total lack of ability (or willingness?) to think about these issues rationally combined with people calling me anti-feminist when I point out that this is irrational has convinced me that I am (and should be!) against the actual existing-in-the-real-world thing called \"feminism\" (as opposed to the \"women should have the same rights as men, including the right to walk around without fear\" definition of feminism, which I am enthusiastically in favor of, and which seems diametrically opposed to feminism-in-practice).\\n\\nChange my view, please. It would make my life a lot easier if I didn\\'t believe these things. Only actual real world data has any significant chance of changing my mind, but I am also curious to hear the non-data-driven arguments, so as to better understand where the people who disagree with me are coming from and why they believe what they believe.\\n\\nCitations: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_the_United_States#Violent_crime\\n\\nNational Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey 2010, page 19', 'op-title': 'CMV: It makes no sense that women are more afraid of walking around alone than men are', 'pair_ids': ['p_1135'], 'train': 1})}),\n",

These kinds of statements are also often directed mainly towards girls/women. Proponents of this will say that when a young girl sees a supermodel, actress, etc., then she thinks she has to look like that, while a boy will see it and expects that all girls should look that way.\\n\\n\\nI find this logic to be on a slippery slope and unrealistic. I don't think the media presents a bad example at all, they just present the pinnacle of beauty if you will. For example, when I am walking by a Victoria's Secret store and see a huge picure of Candice Swanepoel, I don't imagine or expect all women to look like that. Instead, I take on a more realistic approach and form the opinion that she is one of the most attractive people on the planet. On the flip side, I don't go watch Ocean's 11 and feel bad at the end because I don't look like George Clooney or Brad Pitt.\\n\\n\\n\\nThink of how ridiculous this kind of logic is when you extend it to other things. Would I expect every painter to be on par with Michelangelo, every singer to have a voice like Adele, every pianist to be play like Mozart? Of course not. Just because you aren't as great as they are shouldn't affect your self esteem since they are literally at the pinnacle of their respective field, and in some cases in contention for greatest of all time.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo sum up, I think it is ridiculous to think that the media's constant portrayal of beauty in magazines, movies, TV, etc., is in any way affecting how people view their bodies.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust for clarification I am a guy so that may be influencing my opinion.

I\\'d also like to clarify that, [even though certain styles are annoying](http://cdn02.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2009/01/kim-kardashian-futuristic-sunglasses.jpg) as well, this view does not apply to sunglasses because they hold value in their functionality regardless of the person.\\n\\nMy main beef with fashion glasses is that they take the form of a functional piece of equipment and remove the utility but don\\'t add anything new. Certainly, people can say that the same must be true for accessories like [fashion scarves](http://www.seemashawls.com/img2/9.jpeg) or for things like [leather cuffs](http://thecoolershade.com/store/images/LW350.png). However, even though both of these other examples have roots in utility and function, when the functionality is removed something more ornate is added or possible. In the scarf example, a [utilitarian scarf](https://img1.etsystatic.com/003/0/6104481/il_570xN.377835027_hpgy.jpg) is thick to provide warmth and insulation; a fashion scarf removes the functional thickness but opens the door for [patterned textiles or forms](http://blog.suburbanstylechallenge.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sccfallfashion_scarves-pattern.jpg) that are not possible on thicker scarves. Conversely, glasses forms have been derived from their function; a necessary form to place prescription lenses in front of the eyes. Fashion glasses gain no advantage by removing the function.\\n\\nThe second, more obtuse reason for the annoyance is that there is an odd appropriation of an \"impaired\" image. Wearing fashion glasses is akin to carrying a cane around even though you can walk unhindered with your two legs or, if such a thing were fashionable, wearing a colostomy bag even though you have a fully functioning lower digestive tract. Glasses only exist because there was a need to provide improved function to an impaired organ. If for some reason there was never a need for improving vision, the form of a fashion-only \\'face accessory\\' would probably look much different than glasses.\\n\\nThis largely boils down to me being unable to find an answer to the question: Why?\\n\\n**EDIT:** Thanks for the responses, everyone. I still find them very annoying and unnecessary, but have realized it\\'s more due to my own subjective hang-ups and the definitions I\\'ve created to support my view.

I was an obsessive fan of The Matrix for years, and I can\\'t over-emphasise how appalled I am that the title of \"redpill,\" has been hijacked by the one group on Earth who, in my own estimation, are the least deserving of it on the planet.\\n\\nHere\\'s my problem, feminists.  Although you\\'ll no doubt immediately rush to my comment history after reading this, and find posts which cause you to think otherwise, as a man, I honestly ***want*** to like you.  I really do.  Although we\\'ve since reconciled, my father at one point was a fundamentalist Christian, fascist, anglophiliac asshole, so I understand completely why you hate the patriarchy.  I grew up with it; and believe me when I say that it can be just as fucked up (if for different reasons) when you\\'re a guy who is expected to continue imposing the whole sick routine on women, as it can be for women who are the victims of said routine.\\n\\nI also know that you\\'ve had some genuinely valid issues.  The right to vote, the right to earn the same amount of money as men, the right to education, the right to have careers.  I completely endorse women getting all of those things; in fact truthfully I\\'ve never understood why you didn\\'t have those to begin with.  Back when those things were being persued, the movement didn\\'t seem so bad; but now it has moved on to other things, and I\\'m not sure what the goal seems to be any more.  Maybe you can explain it to me.\\n\\nWhat I\\'m trying to figure out is, how do I ally myself with you, when you seem to hate me so much?  This is the real problem.  All I really see from feminism these days, is hate, hate, hate, hate, and more hate.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen the SCUM Manifesto.  I know several of you will try and claim that that was the work of a single crazy, and that she didn\\'t represent all of you; which I will try to accept.  Assuming that some of you do agree with said manifesto though, isn\\'t it suicidal for me to support the cause of a group of women who apparently want me, as a male, to cease to exist entirely?  I ask this because I know that it is considered politically correct for men to support feminism these days; even though, again, at this point, I\\'m having a hard time understanding how it is in our own best interests to do so.\\n\\nAgain, yes, the PUA/TRP/MRM crowd are fascist assholes.  They dehumanise women, and the pathetic excuses for women who their tactics actually work with, or who support male dominance, are traitors to your cause.  I understand that.  As a man myself, I don\\'t want male dominance; although truthfully I don\\'t want female dominance, either.  I don\\'t really understand why we have to have one or the other.\\n\\nI\\'m never going to join the Mens\\' Rights Movement.  Never.  I think their world is sick, and I don\\'t want it; and I also don\\'t want a woman who herself wants what they do; who wants to be treated like a child or an animal.\\n\\nSo I want feminism to be something I can get behind; but I can\\'t do that in good conscience, with a movement that literally wants me, and all that I supposedly am, to cease to exist.  I don\\'t want to dominate you, or for the PUA sociopaths to dominate you either; but I need some assurance that if I support you, I\\'m not necessarily going to be endorsing my own suicide in the process.\\n\\nPlease, CMV.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Let me also say that more than anything else, I believe strongly in the equality of not only the sexes, but races, sexualities, *everything*. I believe that everyone should be equal and I think this should really be common sense. And yet, I cannot bring myself to call myself a feminist. I think my reasoning for this is sound, and yet I constantly see people talk about how horrible anyone who claims to believe in equality yet doesn\\'t use the term \"feminist\" is. This makes me feel horrible, because there is nothing I want more in the world than for everyone to be treated equally. At first I fought against it, trying to argue my position, and I thought that I was doing well, but I just got called names and mocked for it. Now, a lot of people that I respect very much have been recently saying this same thing (\"Feminism IS equality, the terms \\'humanist\\' and \\'egalitarian\\' are misogynist\"), and I\\'ve come to think that there simply must be something here I\\'m not seeing. I\\'m either overlooking something or being unnecessarily stubborn in a way I can\\'t seem to realize.\\n\\nBefore that, though, here is why I still believe I am at least partially in the right:\\n\\n* The word \"feminist\" implies focus on women, just in its name. I don\\'t mind this when used in connection to women\\'s rights - that\\'s what it\\'s for, right? And I certainly support women\\'s rights, I just don\\'t like the term because it seems to erase the fact that inequality is constant, from both sides. When someone says \"feminism IS the belief in equality for both genders\", they are right, in the technical sense, but by its very nature, feminism only focuses on women\\'s issues. \"Masculinism\" is stupid for the same reason, with the added bonus of devaluing women\\'s issues. I think we need an all-encompassing term, and \"feminism\" does not seem to be it.\\n\\n* I have also been faced with discrimination from so-called \"feminists\" simply for being a man. I understand perfectly that these people are NOT examples of the movement as a whole, but they are prevalent enough that I don\\'t want to use the same word to describe myself as the word they use to excuse their hatred for men (which is the definition of misandry, though they claim that doesn\\'t exist). I have also been discriminated against for not only being a man, but daring to believe in equality. If men truly have more power, isn\\'t it more to the advantage of feminists to get men on their side? Not according to the extremists. But those are extremists; I am digressing.\\n\\n* I understand that the term \"humanist\" was claimed by another movement which did not allow women to join. I don\\'t use that term. I don\\'t use \"egalitarian\" either, if only because of the negative stigma feminists give it, but that word means \"belief in equality for all people\", and I cannot fathom what the problem with that is. That is exactly what I believe. It goes beyond sex or gender, it is all people, and that is how I prefer to think of it. Yet, if I were to call myself an egalitarian, I would be met with cries of such things as \"you\\'re ignoring women\\'s issues\", etc. I don\\'t understand how an all-encompassing term would ignore any part of it. If anything, a term which focuses on women is ignoring part of it.\\n\\n* Women CLEARLY have it MUCH, MUCH WORSE than men. That is the main reason I think Men\\'s Rights in general is a load of rubbish. I think we should solve all issues of equality, but there are priorities that need to be followed, and I think women\\'s rights are the priority right now. However, there are some issues on the opposite side which I think are just as pressing. For example, male victims of domestic abuse have hardly anywhere to get support. Either they are not believed, or they are mocked. It is similar for some male rape victims, though I have heard from a few actual victims that in recent years this has been getting much better. (As a side note, one that I\\'ve seen getting thrown around is the higher suicide rate among men... But I\\'m not sure how that\\'s really relevant, because I don\\'t see a way to change that without simply better mental health care for everyone, and even then the divide would still be there.)\\n\\n* The phrase \"not all men\" has been misused by assholes to distract from real issues, but I don\\'t understand why people don\\'t seem to realize that it\\'s true. If you *don\\'t* believe than *not* all men are like this, then you *do* believe that *all* men are like this - this being misogynistic serial rapist-murderers waiting to happen, if they haven\\'t already. That is sexism. I perfectly understand the ridiculing of the term\\'s most common use, but it seems to get washed away completely because of aforementioned assholes. Isn\\'t that the same thing as discounting feminism because of the man-hating extremists?\\n\\nI think I had more to say but I\\'ve run out of steam, it seems. I really, honestly do want my view to change about this, because I want to be able to understand why everybody else is arguing for the use of the term. Please, help me understand. I am as sincere as I could possibly be.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We\\'d just like to remind you of a couple of things.

In the job market today, those majoring in math related fields always get the higher pay than those majoring in the arts. It seems to me, though I may be wrong, that only the most talented writers, artists, actors,etc get a very high pay. Those that are about average can't really get a stable job, whereas average engineers can get a stable job. It just seems to me that society values mathematical intelligence the most. Also, I think that all those technological innovations like cars, internet,etc have impacted society and it's economy the most. So when I see people with good language skills, when compared with people with good mathematical skills, I tend to view the people with good mathematical skills as more intelligent. Since those in math related fields earn on average a higher pay, I conclude that they are more valued by society, and therefore have more worth than those that are not so mathematically inclined.\\n\\nBasically, I need help changing this two views of mine that are interconnected, because those are the roots of a problem that I have. I will be very happy indeed if anyone here can help me in my problems, since you all seem very intelligent. \\n\\nGrowing up, my parents and teachers place the utmost importance on academic achievement and I seem to get the message that if you are not smart enough, then you are just not good enough.

So I place my entire self worth on my intelligence and naturally, because of that, I would like to be smarter than average, because it boosts my ego. Although, I'm well aware that I'm not even clots to the smartest people out there,I find this constant comparison with my peers extremely narcissistic. One part of my mind wants to view myself as equal to everyone else, while the other doesn't because it diminishes my own self importance. So, I don't know how to deal with these two very conflicting thoughts of mine. \\n\\n\\nI do hope that you smart guys can help me out on my problem, though I know it is not a view.

This way, people in the distant future will no longer be offended by the mere utterance of a word, without any regard to its intent of use.\\n\\nAllow me to tell a little back story. I used to feel sick to my stomach when someone would say nigger, no matter how it was used. \"Nigga\" was fine by me though, and I would say it all the time as a joke to my friends. \"What\\'s up my nigga?\" I never felt bad about it and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyD3pomSxko) is a perfect explanation of my reasoning (I\\'m white).\\n\\nSo a few years back, my roommate and I fell into the League of Legends trap. We would play for hours every day, and eventually my roommate\\'s friend from back home started playing with us. I had never met the guy(We\\'ll call him Tyler), but he was hilarious and would always talk an unbelievable amount of shit to the other team. Then one day, it happened. We had just lost a game, and Tyler called the other team \"niggers\". I was pretty uncomfortable, but my roommate thought it was hilarious. The next thing you know, after every game, the last thing they would type is \"GGNNs\". When someone from the other team would ask what it meant, they would say \"Good Game Nigger Noobs!!\" and start busting up laughing.\\n\\nFor about a year this continued, and over the course of time, I started laughing. I began to think it was hilarious. I started joining in, calling people niggers, and laughing my ass off. We even changed our names in the game to end in \"Reggin\". We were the Reggin Brothers, and we called people niggers every game. However, we would only call a certain type of player a nigger. When someone on our team would mess up terribly, or say something childish that didn\\'t make any sense, we called them a nigger.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s when it hit me: we had just reattributed the word to mean something entirely different than its original meaning, similar to what happened to the word \"fag\". My roommate and I had many discussions about this, and we decided it would be in the best interest of the general population to use it as much as possible so as to desensitize people to it, and to lessen violence from misinterpretation over a spoken word. To us, the word now meant either:\\n\\n(a) A highly unskilled person, or\\n(b) A shitty person with no intention of improving, be it their lives or their skills \\n\\nThat pothead loser that crashes on your couch for months and eats all your food without any gratitude? A nigger. The guy at your work that does as little work as possible while riding the coattails of your coworkers? A nigger. The dude on your sports team that sucks ass and doesn\\'t even go to practice? The biggest nigger.\\n\\nThe fact that I can freely talk with my friends about \"The Nigger Life\" as we so called it awakened me to the idea that maybe someday, people will not get so offended by the use of a word. My friend group consists of a variety of races, and we believe that all races are equal, and people should not be judged at all based on skin color. However, I do judge people based on opinions, and if you are one to get offended over a word, then I might just call you a nigger.\\n\\n\"I have a dream, that one day, a man shall not be called a Nigger based on the color of his skin, but on the content of his character\"\\n\\nThanks for reading, and you are welcome to try and change my view.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Backstory: there\\'s women that have been in my life over the past few years that have accused me of being a misogynist for a variety of reasons. I had a discussion today that resulted in me, again, being called a misogynist. As of right now I tend to assume it\\'s just an insult that\\'s being cast at me because I\\'ve \"won\" an argument, thus being used as an easy-out. However, what if it\\'s true? If so, I should probably work on some self-improvement right?\\n\\nHere\\'s why I think I *might* be a misogynist:\\n\\n* Let\\'s just start by saying I absolutely despise the mother of my child as it seems to be a frequent reason I\\'m interpreted as a \"woman hater.\" It would be false to say that I haven\\'t let my experiences with her have an affect on me, but it would also be false to say that because I hate her I must hate all women.\\n\\n* Second: perhaps what I would see as my closest-to-misogynistic trait. It\\'s more difficult for women to gain my trust. This generally only applies to women who I\\'m considering a relationship with. Probably leads into my next point. However, I don\\'t have a problem being friends with women or associating with them because how much do you *really* need to be able to trust a friend or associate? On that level, I think distrust everyone fairly equally. For that matter, I don\\'t really try to get into relationships with men so... maybe I would distrust men in the same way? Not sure.\\n\\n* In all likelihood because of the above point I don\\'t usually give two flying fucks about having sex or especially getting into a committed relationship that extends beyond dating.\\n\\n* On occasions outside of the above: I do from time to time partake in \"no strings\" or \"friends with benefits\" arrangements. I make my intentions clear from as early as possible, but when asked about escalating to a legitimate relationship I tend to back out of the arrangement and put an end to it. I see this as my best effort to not \"lead someone on\" or \"tie them down\" because clearly we don\\'t share the same end-game. If I wanted a relationship that\\'s what I would have aimed for from the beginning.\\n\\n* I have standards. The few times I have been in relationships my significant other has been attractive and, since the break-up with my son\\'s mother, had some level of intelligence. I won\\'t consider a relationship, even a no-strings one, with someone who is overweight or I perceive to be, for lack of a nicer way of saying it, an idiot.\\n\\n* My immediate reaction to someone announcing they are a feminist is a negative one. I\\'m not a fan of the MRM either, but that\\'s mostly because of all of the whining and lack of motivation to actually accomplish anything. At least they acknowledge some of the same issues that affect my life. I feel like feminists as a group are actively fighting against what I am. Not saying I can\\'t eventually respect a feminist or that I would suddenly dislike someone upon finding out that they are a feminist, but if part of my first impression of someone is that they are a feminist it\\'s a red mark, so to speak. I realize they\\'re not all bad, I really do, but my experiences with people who are willing to speak up and say they are a feminist (outside of Reddit) have *always* been bad ones.\\n\\n* I have put my hands on a woman once. A knife was involved. I\\'ve had two relationships where I was punched, kicked, bit, and verbally abused. One of them was, you guessed it, my son\\'s mother. On no other occasion have I hurt a woman. (sex accidents excluded)\\n\\n* **EDIT: Adding this point, as I didn\\'t think about it at the time of typing.** I\\'ve been called a misogynist for believing that prostitution should be legal and admitting that when I\\'m older and I have less options plus more money I\\'ll probably be willing to pay for sex. I also occasionally go to strip clubs with friends.\\n\\nThat being said, here\\'s the main reasons I think I am NOT a misogynist:\\n\\n* I don\\'t cheat out of respect for my partner, I would think this kind of mentality is the *opposite* of a misogynist. However, I\\'m told that the fact that I have zero tolerance or forgiveness for a cheating partner means I see them as an \"object that I own.\" Wtf?\\n\\n* I\\'m not controlling, one of many traits that probably led to the demise of the relationship between my son\\'s mother and I. In spite of that, when I\\'m in a relationship I don\\'t make it a point to \"lock down\" my significant other. Again, I\\'d think the fact that I don\\'t see women as objects to be controlled is a pretty clear indication that I\\'m *not* a misogynist.\\n\\n* I\\'m respectful as fuck to women, especially compared to how I interact with other men. I make it a point to watch my mouth more and I\\'m *much* more likely to shrug off an offensive comment. \\n\\nI\\'m more than willing to honestly answer any questions if more clarification is needed, and if I get no responses I\\'m going to be sure to use an empty thread as a reference the next time one of my female affiliates decides to call me a misogynist. I say I\\'m not, CMV.\\n\\n**FINAL EDIT:** I knew I could count on you guys to make me feel like a horrible person! In all seriousness, though, thank you everyone for your input! As a TL;DR for curious individuals:\\n\\nI had never considered the fact that misogyny was anything beyond *hating* women given the context in which it\\'s typically used. I do have some misogynistic tendencies: the prime one, ironically, being something I listed as something that I thought was the complete opposite of misogyny. Fuck me, right? Anyways, I\\'ve also been made well-aware of the fact that my presentation could use some work. I don\\'t honestly know if I\\'ll ever be able to \"lift the veil\" any faster with women than I can with men, but I\\'ll work on it.

Your ability to learn and be edified, I feel, is directly hindered by self-confidence.\\n\\nIn my experience, I have learned so much more by questioning what I already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself. I often find that the most effective means of approaching a situation is to consider as much about it as I can, and tentatively operate on what conclusions I do draw, but constantly questioning those conclusions until either they work for me or no longer hold water. I think that there is no such thing as overthinking, and that any situation can only ever be improved by careful consideration.\\n\\nConsequently, I see people that display confidence in themselves and their beliefs as almost intentionally maintaining a blissful ignorance. I do see it as one thing to have a faith, and quite another to be a fanatic, but I do feel that the divide between those may be a question of confidence. It is also possible to speak with some measure of certainty about your interests and knowledge, but it is usually best, I feel, to be prepared to re-examine your perspectives on even fundamental beliefs at any moment.\\n\\nThese perspectives, I do not feel, have served me very well. I find myself despising confident people as they speak with pride about things they have never once questioned.

It seems that many use someone's confidence as a measure for how correct or successful they are, when if anything, to me, it conveys only willful ignorance. What am I missing?

Basically, the idea is that if a company has more money, it'll hire more people, which reduces unemployment and boosts the economy. \\n\\nMy logic thusfar: first, as far as I'm aware, there is no evidence that this tactic has ever worked.\\n\\nWith that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like Walmart, McDonald's, etc. For some reason, I doubt that a company like Walmart with a $40 billion net profit needs more money to hire people. Most of the tax revenue the federal government would lose in a tax cut would be going to companies like this that don't actually need it. And we, as taxpayers, would either have to pay for the difference through our own taxes, or take cuts to other services.\\n\\nBut let's look at the other companies that would be saving money through tax cuts; the ones that supposedly would benefit and hire more people. Let's say the economy is stagnant (i.e. neither growing nor shrinking), and demand is flat for those companies. They have enough employees and resources to meet demand. Now, give them some money to hire more people. What are their choices for that money? Well, supposedly they can hire a few people, and those few people getting an income will help create demand for products. The problem is, those people aren't going to turn around and spend their entire paycheck on products produced by just that company, so the company is going to get back less than they invested in their workers.\\n\\nNow, supposedly tax cuts across multiple companies will create widespread demand, but as a company, what is the better business decision: wait for demand to increase, then hire people to meet it; or hire people, and risk not having demand rise to meet your now excess production (or maybe risk having your excess production become obsolete before it can be sold)? Obviously, the better business decision is the first. Unlike the second, it is no risk and guarantees the company saves money, and if every company makes that same decision, then no one will ever get hired, defeating the theory that corporate tax cuts will create jobs.\\n\\nWhat's more, if demand is outstripping production, then, assuming the company is actually functioning like any company should, it should be turning a profit, which would allow it to hire more people anyway. And if demand is so great that they can't hire enough people to meet it, then they can just resort to other sources of funding, like loans, to expand production. This has worked for countless companies in the past, and will continue to do so in the future.\\n\\nIn the third situation, where demand is dropping, the company is more likely going to be trimming it's workforce, not wanting to hire more people.\\n\\nThere is a reason why there is no evidence that giving money to corporations  works. It doesn't directly create demand, and the smart business decision is to wait for demand to increase before investing in increased production. And even then, as a profitable business, it should have the resources necessary to do so anyway.\\n\\nI'm sure I'm missing things, but what? And are they actually enough to offset the flaws I'm currently thinking about?\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

There is evidence to show that high fructose corn syrup is also an addictive substance. And the artificial sweeteners that can be used in its stead also come with their host of problems. Along with all the alarmist news stories about e-cigarette use increasing among high school students, I feel that the public should be every bit as outraged by products like Mountain Dew and Coca Cola being marketed to children and teenagers.\\ufeff \\n\\nThe only active substances in the liquid used in an e-cigarette are nicotine, propylene glycol, vegetable glycerine and flavour extracts. Propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine are all approved for public consumption by the FDA and are commonly used as food additives. Propylene glycol is commonly used in ice cream to keep it from going hard. The temperatures used in vaporizing the e-liquid are only enough to cause a phase change and far too low to cause combustion, which is where most of the harmful chemicals are formed when smoking tobacco.\\n\\nThe only reason why e-cigarettes are banned from sale to minors is due to the continuing stigma from the risks of smoking tobacco. Change my view: If we allow the sale of caffeinated soft drinks to minors, we should also allow the sale of e-cigarettes.

I believe they can only account for me the way an actuary can attempt to render the status of something mathematically -- with an eye for values and eventually profit.

I tend to look at massive scale operations from a serious \"how can I make profit off of this\" perspective as I believe it is the safest assumption that can be made about people and groups with such a crushing responsibility to fulfill so many needs.

This could be a stay at home dad, foster parent, etc. I just used the term mother because that is usually the default term. \\n\\nPeople always tend to say that being a mother is such a difficult job. Even worse is when people say it is the hardest job in the world. I strictly disagree. \\n\\nCertainly, being a parent of any type is difficult as you are responsible for raising a child to be a responsible citizen. Any decision you make ultimately has an impact on how they turn out as an adult. \\n\\nHowever, it seems that as long as you are able to provide certain basic needs, they will generally end up as functioning adults. Most children just need basic things such as love and stability. Once you are able to provide those things, most of the job is just tedious and time consuming. Eventually everything just falls into a routine. This is especially true for the pre-adolescent ages before they are capable of taking certain responsibilities into their own hands. As they get older, the role of the parent starts to become less mandatory for their development and can even become harmful to the development of the child if there is too much involvement (ex. helicopter parents).\\n\\nThe actual difficulty just comes from figuring out what kind of strategy you want to utilize to raise your kid. After you figure that out, everything falls into order. Running the household while watching the kid turns into menial tasks such as cleaning up after them, picking up groceries, making sure they go to bed on time, controlling how much TV they watch, etc. None of these are particularly difficult, just time consuming. Thus, it is no more difficult than most other jobs that are just as time consuming and menial. \\n\\nTo say that this job is more difficult than say a brain surgeon would be unfair. A brain surgeon runs the risk of permanently screwing up a person for life with one wrong move of their scalpel. On top of that, in order to perform such surgery you need to train for years before you are anywhere close to being ready to operate. Where as being a mother just kind of happens and you are able to figure it out along the way. \\n\\nIn the event of children with extra needs, such as those with mental/physical handicaps, this certainly makes the role of being a parent more difficult in the day to day type of life. However, in the end everything comes down to routine once you figure out a strategy. In my view, I think one of the hardest parenting scenarios is having a child with extreme depression where there is a risk of suicide or self-harm. In this scenario there is not always much a parent can do because of the child's biological predisposition to their condition, and it can be even harder because their child could end up dead. While this may be emotionally straining on the parental figure, it still can not justify being a parent as the hardest job in the world, especially since most parents do not have to deal with this scenario. \\n\\nGo ahead, CMV. I'll make sure to award deltas to anyone who successfully does so. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The first is that the school is not responsible for providing any other consumable goods to the students (pencil, paper, clothing, etc.) and it is unreasonable to arbitrarily assign the responsibility of nutrition to them.

The need for lunch is not caused in any way by the student being in school, and I cannot understand why the parent would be absolved of this responsibility due to a change in venue.\\n\\nPlease note, my argument does not include parents who provide lunch for their children by signing up for the free/reduced lunch program, as I feel this adequately fulfilled their responsibility.\\n\\nPlease help me, as I can\\'t help but feel all the people who argue for free lunches for all students are a bit off their rockers.

I don\\'t mean to use this article the basis of my argument, and I don\\'t want to spend my time defending it, I just wanted to included for those interested. Essentially, my current train of thought is as follows. Voter turnout in the United States has turned into a huge issue that politicians and those more politically inclined have latched onto. I believe this probably stems from the civil rights era in which disenfranchised minority voters were \"denied\" (through unfair voting regulations, e.g. voting tests) the right to a political vote. The push to get them involved has continued but has become more harmful now that blanket anti-discriminatory laws regarding voting regulations have been put in place. I\\'m sure we are all very familiar with the pushes to get out and vote (Especially among the youth vote- \"Rock the Vote!\"). I am under the impression that this has done nothing more than increased the amount of uneducated voting and turned the electoral process into nothing more than a popularity contest which then in turn is perpetuated by other electoral issues such as allotted campaign funds. I currently believe that voting rights should be more regulated, such as voting tests (equal across all constitutionally protected groups) in order to ensure a stronger and more educated vote. I do believe that this blog summarized this point more clearly than I can:\\n&gt;We act as though voting is this Mystical Rite in which we all must partake; the health of our nation rests on our ability to shovel as many warm bodies into the voting booth as possible. The reality, of course, is the exact opposite. Voting is a tool, not a sacrament. We use it to select the people who will pass laws and make important decisions. There’s nothing inherently virtuous about taking part in that task just for the sake of it. Take part if you have something useful and constructive to contribute. Otherwise, stay home, for the good of the nation.\\n\\nThe only argument I\\'ve heard before discussing this issue that has even begun to slightly sway me from this position that voting tests should be more common place, is the idea that they would take away the voice from those who do not have the time or resources to educate themselves enough to pass these tests. Mostly the lower class and uneducated. However, I would see them included in the voting pool as more harmful as they are essentially just throwing their vote at individuals whom they are not fully knowledgeable about. As far as resources go, public information that would be required on such tests would be extremely available given the amount of publicly available resources we have now (libraries, the internet, etc.). \\n\\nTime, on the other hand, is what I agree with. When you have a hard-working individual who simply can\\'t dedicate the time to learning this information then is that enough to take away their political voice? My thoughts on this though are similar to those who are too lazy to make the effort. Voting should be done by an informed and knowledgeable group of individuals. **If one was to just simply vote blindly or misinformed (as many Americans do) then they are doing more harm to the political system then if they were simply excluded from the voting pool.**\\n\\nI can understand that this thought process would dramatically decrease voter turnout, but I don\\'t see that as a bad thing. What I am looking for is an argument explaining to me why a smaller voter turnout is so dangerous, or why removing the uninformed voter from the electoral process is worse then including them. Thanks! \\n\\nEDIT: As of right now I\\'ve had my opinion changed by /u/phobophilophobia and /u/sarcasmandsocialism\\'s arguement that because most of America has a moderate and informed/sensible political opinion but because low voter turnout lessens this voice, decreasing it even more would be worse then increasing the voting pool. I\\'m still undecided on how I feel about effort to participate in the political system should be factored into voting rights, but as of right now, I\\'ve changed my view on voting tests and the like.\\n \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In the past few years, the use of hops to add flavor dimensions to many brews is overdone.

Many of the brewers pride themselves on the IBU (International Bitterness Unit) numbers for these beers, trying to push them further and further into bitter territory.\\n\\nThis discouraging in many ways.  First, it leads to a false perception that craft beer *must* be bitter.  It also means that other styles of beer, either imported or from craft breweries, are needlessly crowded out of the discussion.  I personally am a fan of many of the Belgian styles, (for example the abbey dubbels, and abbey beers in general). Many Belgian beers are willing to use some more interesting ingredients that would get overwhelmed by too hopped.  Outside of that I find  I also like bocks, doppelbocks, porters,  and others.

I think that the false perception remains, and that IPAs and hoppier beers still dominate the discussion.  This in turn, leads less people to venture into microbrews.   However, it was rightly pointed out that it is still possible to get variety from a proper beer seller.  I still think that IPAs, etc end up taking up an outsize portion of the shelf space.

This would allow the mundane details of government to be handled by people paid to do so, while improving the ability of the people to have their voice heard on larger issues.

The money he possesses, obtained from the profits of his many businesses is never re-invested. This is a huge blow to the economy, since by not being re-invested :\\n\\n- consumption is lowered and the money doesn't benefit companies and therefor the workers, who, by not getting paid higher, will spend less, thus creating even lower wages and unemployment. This vicious circle cripples the economy. \\n\\n- people and small businesses cannot loan it, this makes opening your own business very hard. And since Scrooge owns most of the businesses around, this could very much be an anti-competion technique. These shenanigans against entrepreneurship create unemployment and poverty.\\n\\nSecondly the amount of money he possesses in not clear. Amounts vary from *one multiplujillion, nine obsquatumatillion, six hundred twenty-three dollars and sixty-two cents* to *607 tillion 386 zillion 947 trillion 522 billion dollars and 36 cents* and sometimes *five multiplujillion, nine impossibidillion, seven fantasticatrillion dollars and sixteen cents*\\n\\nThis makes it very hard to assess the value of the currency, which could also be very fluctuant, an obsquatumatillion could become as worthless as a fantasticatrillion very quickly. This is very bad for the stock-exange market.\\n\\nAlso, people have calculated that based on it's size, his money bin could only contain $27 trillion. This could mean that he could be hiding the multiplujillions in overseas accounts, safe from the IRS.\\n\\nAlso, since there is only $77 trillion worth of things in the world, this means that, if the calculations on the money bin are correct, Scrooge owns 35% of the world's money. And since the world's second richest is Flinthead Glomgold who owns about he same amont, that means the population of the donald universe owns less than 30% of the world's riches, the two richest owning about 70%. \\n\\nSo in the duck universe, the richest 1% (or in this case 2,86x10^-8 % assuming there are 7 billion inhabitants in their world) swims around in their gold, rubbing it on their feathered skin whilst the rest of the population and the economy suffers.\\n\\nI believe Scrooge McDuck is a plague to the economy.

Had he succeeded in his endeavors (who usually fail with an ironic twist of fate), he could have made gold and diamonds less valuable by bringing back too much of it.\\n\\nEdit 2 : A lot of very very good and entertaining comments, you guys are awesome !\\n\\nEdit 3 : My first Gold ! holly shit !

The lowest paid employees in their company maybe made $20k.  Ball park, that means that the CEO is 1000 times more valuable than her lowest paid janitor...\\n\\nThis speaks to me of a kind of hubris and greed that reasons in the following way:  The three of us work together, and all make 50k/yr.  At the end of the year, I'm promoted to 'manager' of the two remaining workers.  Now, it's not 'fair' for us all to still be paid the same, after all I'm in charge.  So take the same budget, $150k, and now I'm the 'boss' so I make 80k and so all that's left for the two people I manage is $35k each.  Repeat this say 4 or 5 times through middle and upper management, and we arrive at a situation like were in today.  Huge executive compensation, but why?\\n\\nNow, if the maximum salary in the company was 60k and I was offered a promotion to manager, would I somehow be less inclined to take it? What about the next jump, to 70k? and the next to 80? Why isn't it enough that my decisions are now guiding and leading the group and I have received a small merit increase?  Why should I also make  ~50% to double what the people who report to me are making?\\n\\nWhy rely on a tax system to progressively tax higher incomes to provide services, rather impose a moral code that says companies may not salary(+bonuses) their employees at higher than a net total of 150k/yr during a 40 year career? [that is, liquid net worth should be &lt; 6M and our salary scale should be re-adjusted such that a diligent worker hits this 6M mark after 40 years, while a very hard worker could do it in 20-25).  Also, consider the studies that have shown people who make more than $80k/yr report to being just as happy and satisfied as people who make $800k/yr\\n\\nNow I'd be willing to consider exemptions for Pro-athletes, or other 'time dependent' jobs (artist, architect etc) could still make nearly a million dollars per year, since their 'careers' when they are making a large amount of money could be relatively short.  I'm not convinced that the athletes who make 10s of millions work or train 10 times harder than a teammate who makes 250k/yr.  Or that the artist who manages to sell his painting for 1M worked a lot harder than the artist who sells it for $1,000\\n\\nThat is, I think that monetary value is inherently subjective and that we don't usefully understand the systems that determine the price of a good, or an appropriate salary for work performed. For example, [how much should it cost per night to board a dog?](http://dogvacay.com/)  In this case, regulation is needed.\\n\\nLastly, I think once you start making a large amount of money, it becomes nearly impossible to see how you 'aren't worth this much' and so it is up to society to provide the framework we can all agree to before we know how lucky, or talented we might be.\\n\\n\\nOk but there's a huge problem; lots of people already have net worth more than 6M, or are paid way more than 150k/yr... and how do we handle telling them?\\n\\nwith that, CMV.\\n\\nObviously, since i just brought it up, I'm not that interested in counter arguments about how impractical such a change is/would be.  I'm asking for CMV arguments that look at why a maximum salary has little merit and so, why financial motivation is so strong a driver, despite the evidence that it does not making people any happier.\\n\\nEDIT1: people seem to be arguing that it's not the payee, but the payer who has the moral or ethical obligation here.  What I'm looking for in the CMV is an compelling ethical argument that provides evidence that paying higher salaries yields some MORE good in the world than the inequality it creates.  That society is better off because people can be paid arbitrarily high salaries. I'm asking for someone to convincingly honestly articulate a Gordon Gekko 'Greed is good' point of view.\\n\\nEdit2: Thanks for all the responses.  I'll get back to more of you tomorrow.\\n\\nEdit3: People are hung up or think that by saying there is an ethical limit, that implies a legal limit, or a taxable limit.  This is not the case.  People can continue to request huge salaries, and companies will continue to pay them. My point is that their behavior (by me) is viewed as unethical.  Why should I think that because the market will pay them that salary that they should accept it?  What imbues the market with knowledge of what is right and wrong, rather than what 'can be done'?  All things that can be done, shouldn't.\\n\\nEdit4:  Well, 500+ comments later, and I only awarded two ∆s... However, this has been really interesting and stimulating. So thanks everyone.  I went through and upvoted all the top posts because I did want to thank everyone in some small way for participating.  I think my biggest take-away is that lots of you think that growth and/or efficiency are inherently good.  I readily admit to being skeptical.  I think that measured growth is good/necessary, but like nature, only so much growth should be allowable before some other check should come in.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Most atheists will base their position on abortion on their perception of the evidence and their own moral convictions. This makes it much harder to oppose abortion during the first three months because a fetus lacks a number of important features during that time frame; it is not conscious until 24-28 weeks, for example ([source](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-does-consciousness-arise/)).

Stealing must be punished by cutting off fingers (older laws, at least). Generally, the \"level\" of punishment *must* match the *level* of crime. You can\\'t execute someone for stealing, and you can\\'t simply fine somebody for raping another person. Even in the Bible, law is laid out in a likewise manner. \"An eye for an eye, and a foot for a foot.\" \\n\\nWhy is it that Christianity is allowed to preach such a double standard? When you go to hell, it\\'s forever. When you go to heaven, it\\'s forever. What kind of crime could possibly require an infinite punishment? What sort of act of kindness could desereve an infinite reward? You can\\'t kill an infinite number of people. You can\\'t feed an infinite number of homeless. This is simple mathematics, and it follows directly from the very law christianity seems to teach.\\n\\nthe fundamentalist Christians would probably claim that I\\'m projecting human definitions onto a God whom defies human comprehension. Well, I am. Basically, God handed down a very cut and dry definition of justice, and then claimed that it didn\\'t apply to the afterlife. Why wouldn\\'t it? If I tell a kid he\\'ll go into time out if he steals a cookie, he understands that the punishment is somehow \"restoring balance.\" But then if I say, \"but, if you don\\'t tell your friends how great I am, you\\'ll never eat cookies again. And it\\'s gotta be today. Better go find your friends,\" he\\'d think that was completely unfair, and he\\'d be right. So why does God get to do it?\\n\\nI know this argument is laced with emotion, but I really am trying to appeal to reason. If the human definition of justice applies to God, then heaven and hell are both completely unjust and paradoxical. Inversely, if it doesn\\'t apply, then heaven and hell might be just and fair (by god\\'s definition), but in a way that is an insult to human reason, and I\\'d be obligated to give God the finger if (s)he tried to send me to heaven *or* hell.\\n\\nIn short, my view is that humans have no obligation or reason to worship a god who is not, by human standards, fair and just. While god certainly is not bound by human definitions, I think it\\'s ludicrous to worship him/her if (s)he doesn\\'t obey what human\\'s understand as logic.\\n\\nWhile the act of \"defying human logic\" is not necessarily evil (quantum mechanics defies human logic) my argument is that humans have no grounds to trust a *conscious being* which defies logic. One might say, \"but if he defies logic, then we have no choice but to trust him.\" And I\\'d say that\\'s B.S. We can trust quantum mechanics because it\\'s been verified experimentally over and over. God can\\'t be experimented on, he can only be reasoned about. If he defies reason, then he might as well be an insubstantial ghost with no bearing on reality.\\n\\nWhat really pisses me off is the possibility that I might end up in hell for relying on reason, while others end up in heaven for abandoning it.\\n\\nSince I allowed emotion to slip into my argument, I\\'ll allow minor appeals to emotion, but please try to convince me using solid reason and logic. Perhaps I\\'m merely misinterpretting christian theology, but I\\'d say it was pretty cut and dry.\\n\\nI know this was a lot, so let me summarize:\\n\\n1. Christianity (and other religions) teaches that god is just, and we\\'ll all either end up in either heaven or hell. \\n\\n2. Justice (by human definition) requires that punishments fit crimes. Finite crime = finite punishment. There is no such thing as an infinite crime. Ergo, infinite punishments are unjust. By symmetry, infinite rewards are unjust.\\n\\n3. Reason is humanity\\'s most reliable tool. Abandoning it should be punished, not rewarded. If god rewards us for abandoning reason, or punishes us for relying on it, then I hate him, and I believe that hate is completely justified under god\\'s own law, making it a very paradoxical and contradictory situation.\\n\\nEDIT 1:\\n\\nIt\\'s come to my attention that I was making a blanket generalization abou christian theology. I wasn\\'t aware that many sects preach a non-permanent Heaven/Hell. In that case, my argument doesn\\'t apply to those sects, only to sects that preach permanent hell *and* a {fair, just, good, loving, omnipotent} god. The only such sect that\\'s been mentioned thus far is protestant christianity, in which I was raised by my parents. Many of my friends also follow this particular teaching. Therefore I\\'m trying to acquire some talking points for my discussions with them about heaven/hell/god. \\n\\nMy view still hasn\\'t been changed, so please continue to try to do so.\\n\\nThe main point that hasn\\'t really been contested, and yet is truly my central argument, is as follows: Any religion, which preaches a permanent heaven and hell *and* a {fair, just, good, loving, omnipotent} god is logically inconsistent. This is because *finite* crimes and *finite* decisions should not require *infinite* punishments and *infinite* consequences.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I am actually interested in having my view changed.\\n\\nFirst, let me give you a little background to explain why I feel the way that I do about the concept of a supernatural being, particularly those held as deities by the major world religions. I was raised in a somewhat fundamentalist Christian household, and I fully believed the majority of what I was taught until around the age of 16. Even when I would question some things, I could usually find satisfactory answers to my questions through research or by talking to a pastor, youth group leader, family member or friend. However, as I got older and was became friends with people who held world views that starkly contradicted my own, I started questioning some of the more basic concepts of my faith- not out of rebellion or disdain, but simply out of a desire to learn more. In fact, at this point I thought that it was simply God’s way of making me a stronger Christian, and that once I found the answers I was looking for I would be able to confidently explain them to anyone who asked me the same questions. However, as time went on, I continued to pray, read, and talk about the doubts I was having, but I ended up coming to the conclusion that there were irreconcilable contradictions within the Bible and within the concept of God (or at least the God of Christianity, at that point). When I stopped believing in God, it was not a decision, but simply a realization that I no longer thought that the things I had learned my entire life were completely true. \\n\\nThat all happened a few years back. Since then I have had a few back-and-forth periods between trying to believe again and completely rejecting anything having to do with religion, but as I spent more time at college and had more time to think about and explore my beliefs, I have started to feel more and more that the idea of God is no more than a fairy tale to help people feel better about a world and a life that can be somewhat bleak at times. I still try to respect my family’s beliefs, because they really do try to respect mine as well, but the more time I spend apart from the church, the more I realize how silly it all sounds to me. Additionally, I have now had some time to look into other religions as well, and despite their differences (and my admittedly limited knowledge of them compared to Christianity), I find that most of them fall into the same category- fantastical stories, which are well-intentioned and (arguably) decent as moral guides, but most likely largely fictional. I acknowledge that most of the figureheads of the religions (i.e. Jesus, Muhammad, etc.) were real people, but I think they were nothing more than philosophical leaders who were deified after their deaths. \\n\\nSo now that I’ve explained why I don’t believe in any god, here is what I do believe. I believe that science represents the best of our knowledge and understanding of the world. While we do not know everything, and we never will, I do not see that as a reason to fill in the gaps with supernatural explanation. As long as we continue to pursue more knowledge and advancement through the rigor of scientific experimentation and theory, we will learn as much as we can about the universe we live in, and that is good enough for me. I believe that when we die, we simply cease to exist, and as such I believe it is important to make as much out of this life as possible. I believe that any religion is a largely primitive and illogical construct created simply out of the human desire to believe that there is more to life than meets the eye, and that religion as a whole will largely disappear at some point in the future of the human race.\\n\\nYou could change my view by convincing me of one of a few things. (A) I have only completely rejected religion because of my fundamentalist upbringing, and a lesser form of Christianity or some other religion might fit into a logical view of the world. (B) Science and religion (specifically one of the major world religions) are not mutually exclusive, and can instead complement one another for a more complete understanding of life.\\nI should add that simply stating that believing in God would be a good thing will not be enough. Just because something would be nice or convenient does not mean I can force myself to believe it.\\n\\nAddendum: In case anyone is wondering, the reason I want to have my view changed is simple. Where I live, most people are religious, and I feel that it would greatly help my relationship with a lot of people if I at least believed in something, even if I never return to a full belief in Christianity. Furthermore, I am currently dating a girl who is absolutely amazing and with whom I mesh perfectly in just about every other way, but she is a Christian (although not nearly as fundamentalist as my family) and has expressed some concern about my lack of faith. While she has not tried at all to push me towards changing that aspect of myself, I would hate for that to be the one thing that stands between us and long term happiness, so I’m taking the initiative. That may seem like a cheap reason to want to change my entire world view, but it is what it is- and honestly, maybe having something to believe in wouldn’t be so bad for me.\\n\\nSo there you have it. I may be barking up the wrong tree since I know reddit doesn’t have a whole lot of outspoken religious people, but if anyone feels up to the challenge, please Change My View.\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I don’t want to get into semantics so I’m not claiming to be a follower of classical liberalism or neo-liberalism or anything else but a modern and hyper liberal American.  Since I love this subreddit I’ll provide you with some easy arguments for you to knock down.  =)  I will change my view if you can show how ‘forward thinking, inclusivism, secularism, or personal liberty’ are bad values to have or show in some way that being a modern liberal is bad for myself or society. \\n\\nWHAT IS LIBERALISM? \\n\\n1) \\tForward Thinking –  I believe social liberalism correctly pushes the boundaries of what society currently thinks is acceptable towards more egalitarian bounds.  Conservative thinking is dominated by ideas like “tradition” and “maintaining order or status quo” which it advances at the cost of excluding certain groups.  I specifically believe that tradition is harmful as it inappropriately resists change without providing merit.  I believe the abolition of slavery, suffrage of women, lax immigration policies, and the guaranteeing of rights by the government are liberal ideas that are beneficial to society.\\n\\n2) \\tInclusivism – I believe liberalism is an ideology that tries to include as many people as possible.  I feel liberalism correctly values the group over the individual.  (ex: What good are ‘my’ rights if I only get them by infringing on others?)  I believe that everyone is better off when everyone is given equal protection and rights.  When employees have enough disposable income to purchase consumer goods they increase economic output much more than if all the income and wealth was concentrated in the hands of few individuals. (see banana republics vs current America and debt fueled consumption as one of the primary cause of the 1930s and 2008 depressions).  \\n\\n3) \\tSECULARISM – I believe that governments and all non-religious groups should operate in a completely secular manner because it provides better real world results and doesn’t disenfranchise anyone.  I believe that corporations should not be able to espouse or enforce particular religious beliefs (ex: a church can be doctrinally against birth control but it, nor any business, should not be allowed to deny said birth control to its employees).  In matters of science vs faith I will always side with science as I believe ‘most’ liberals would.  I place zero merits in matters of faith when presented as such and believe morality is not provided by, grounded in, nor should it be regulated by, a religion.  (Any claim not based in fact is either a working hypothesis or a statement of faith.  I may have to accept partial blame for ‘radical hippies’ that do not support data driven science such as gmo haters and nuclear power scardy-cats.  It seems that these people are in the minority among liberals BUT If you feel the ‘average liberal’ supports these types of faith based anti-data claims then please hammer away at me).  \\n\\n\\n4) \\tPERSONAL LIBERTY – The government is the primary protector of the citizen’s rights and liberties.  Personal responsibility outlined by libertarians and conservatives only goes so far since vigilante enforcement is not as conducive to society as official police actions and lynch mobs should be replaced by a judiciary.  Liberals believe that morality and personal behavior should not be regulated by an outside entity.  Free love, marrying whomever you chose, freedom of and from religion, 1st and 4th amendment rights, and the right to privacy, are all liberal ideas that I support.  I do not believe you have the right to infringe on the rights of others.  I believe that women are the equals of men and that all races are equal to each other.  “Separate but equal” is not equal and true equality not only means equal rights but equal opportunity to fulfill those rights.\\n\\nLightning round...\\n\\n5) 2nd Amendment = pro gun ownership, pro heavy regulation\\n\\n6) Big Government = globalization and big businesses need big  government support.  Remember only conservatives say \"I demand big government get their hands off my medicare\".\\n\\n7) Taxes = The required big government needs big income.  Our current government is too big and can be for sure be streamlined, but it cannot be halved or quartered.  \\n\\n8) Climate Change = I side with science.  No, there is no debate.\\n\\n9) Abortion = I can prove with science that the mother is alive.  Until you can prove with science that a specific subset of her cells commonly known as a fetus is a separate and living organism capable of equal amounts of autonomy as the mother then I feel you have no ground to stand on.  \\n\\n10) The Draft = Against it.  Unless America is facing a crisis of civilization ending proportions then there\\'s no need to dilute a strong fighting force with people that don\\'t want to be there.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'm not going to say the movie's awful, because it's not. I'm not even going to say it's bad. And while I did enjoy this movie, I never thought it was something great or revolutionary. \\n\\nFor the sake of argument, I'll list my problems with it:\\n\\n1. Belle.\\n\\nI find her to be void of personality whatsoever. She's very 2D like the old princesses such as Snow White or Aurora. And she's also somewhat of a Mary Sue. What is the likely hood that the prettiest girl in all of the town is also the most well-read, articulate, modest, selfless and non judgemental? She's too perfect of a character for me, with her only negative counterparts being that she is some of those descriptions to a fault. \\n\\n- The love story.\\n\\nBeast is an ACTUAL Beast. He's not just beastly/ very hard on the eyes, he's an actual monster/animal looking thing. He's not human. Like, at all. Belle has no way of knowing that he was once a human and cursed into being a beast. Sure, she goes into that one wing of the castle and sees a picture of the human him on the wall, but if you're telling me that she pieced everything together after that, you're lying to yourself as well. She willingly fell in love with an animal. In a romantic way. Not to mention the fact that he kidnapped her and she fell in love with him, which I think is commonly referred to as Stockholm Syndrome, but idk. \\n\\n- Gaston's death.\\n\\nWhy? Why kill him? Because he tried to kill the beast? In Gaston's defence, the Beast is almost the same character, but with a second chance at redemption. To me killing Gaston was the easy way of just burying that story. We're supposed to hate Gaston and love the Beast but they're just too similar that I can't have such opposing views on them. At least Gaston was humorous and got a song. \\n\\n- Human Beast (appearance wise)\\n\\nNo.\\n\\n- Timing/ pacing\\n\\nThere actually seemed to be a very minimal time that went past in this movie. There was hardly any interaction between the two, thus making me feel as though the love between them didn't exist at all. \\n\\n- The initial conflict. \\n\\nI don't have too big of a problem with this, but his consequences for being a dick don't seem to fit. He gets turned into a beast, which sounds about right, but where my problem lies is where he can't be turned back into a human unless he learns to love another and be loved by another. This, on paper, seems fine, but at the end of the day, he falls in love with the prettiest girl in town. How does that prove anything? I know it's Disney and the possibility of an ugly female love-interest doesn't exist, but it seems a little counter productive to have the man who judges people off of how they look to fall in love with the prettiest girl. \\n\\n/rant\\n\\nIt should be noted again that I don't hate this movie, I rather enjoy it. But there are far better Disney movies out there.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that while I find most of the songs in this movie to be forgettable as hell (how many are there? 3?), I rather enjoy the scene of Tale As Old As Time/ Beauty and the Beast.\\n\\nSo.

I will try and rectify that when I can and reply to as many comments as I can. As of right now my overall opinion of the topic has not changed massively, however you guys have convinced me that the MRM has some very good apples as well.  There are also some deltas that I need to award to some of the best comments in this thread, which I will also do tomorrow when I have the time. Once again, sorry for some poor responses, I didn't expect this many comments, so it was hard to respond to as many of them as I did.

There are several types of prologues, and for each one I can see reasons that they\\'re not needed. I feel that often, inexperienced writers include them because they\\'ve read other fantasy novels that have them and think you\\'re meant to have a prologue in a fantasy novel, but I don\\'t think they work for novels.\\n\\nI refer only to novels in this instance, not to other media like movies, TV shows and comics. I think prologues work fine in visual media, especially films where the first couple of minutes might be accompanied by latecomers finding their seats and conversations begun during the adverts trailing off, to make sure the audience are paying attention.\\n\\nBut in fantasy novels in particular, they\\'re usually one of the following types:\\n\\n1. The history of the world/universe/country. An info dump of history, stars swirling, worlds forming, battles fought and lost or won, magic systems, dragons disappearing and all that stuff. These are boring, because the author is giving me information about a world I have no reason to care about yet, often in a fairly dry tone, lacking in conflict and characters. And what\\'s more, all the information which is actually important can be fed into the story or hinted at gradually - a method I far prefer, because I like working things out about the world as I read and building up my understanding over time.\\n\\n2. The \"father of the hero\" type prologue. Doesn\\'t necessarily include the father of the hero, but often does. This is a scene set, usually, a generation or so earlier than the rest of the novel, involving characters who either don\\'t reappear at all or don\\'t reappear until the final third of the book, by which time I\\'ve forgotten about them. I don\\'t like this type of prologue because it gets me invested in a set of characters only to break with them at the end of the prologue and try to get me invested with a fresh set of characters, and because, as with the history of the world type, they often contain information that could be woven into the story gradually instead.\\n\\n3. The \"hero\\'s normal life\" prologue. At worst, this type is boring, tedious and irrelevant. Sometimes it lacks conflict, just showing how fantastic everything is for the protagonist before something comes along and ruins things. At best, it could be renamed \"chapter 1\". Either it shouldn\\'t be there, or it shouldn\\'t be called a prologue.\\n\\n4. The \"bad things are happening elsewhere\" type prologue. This is the least bad of the lot, I suppose, but still better suited to screen than page. This usually includes either (a) the villain concocting a plan or giving order that will disrupt stuff for the hero we have yet to meet, or (b) some poor sap gets murdered by something. Often, prologues of this type are vague or are clearly deliberately keeping some key piece of information back from the reader.\\n\\nIn general, all prologues share a key flaw: the book has to start twice. The prolgoue is usually self-contained, and so reaching the end of the prologue is like reaching the end of a short story, without the kind of hook to read on and find out what happened to character X that you find at the end of chapters. There\\'s little or no investment in characters, because either there weren\\'t any or those that there were don\\'t reappear until much later in the book, if ever.\\n\\nI therefore find prologues pretty offputting. I will acknowledge that there are some that are done well, by the more experienced writers like George R R Martin, but most of the time seeing the word \"prologue\" on the first page puts me in a mindset that\\'s a lot more critical than I would otherwise be. I want my attitude changed because this isn\\'t a good way to start reading a book. In fact I\\'ve not finished a book in months, though I\\'ve started a few.\\n\\nSaying \"the prologue in book X is good\" isn\\'t going to change my view, because I know some prologues are good, but I feel on balance that they\\'re not a good idea for newer authors in particular.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure what will change my view. A new perspective I\\'ve not thought of, I suppose.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We\\'d just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Some people, including this Princeton student, interpret the phrase as meaning something along the lines of \"fuck you white boy, your opinion is made invalid by the advantages given to you by society.\" As such, that shining bastion of white America, Fox News, sprang to the defense of this kid, to proclaim that prejudice against the opinions of an individual based solely on skin color or gender is wrong, in any form. I certainly agree with that assertion, but \"checking one\\'s privilege\" does not mean that one\\'s opinions are void simply because one is caucasian, or a man, or Christian. Rather, my interpretation of \"checking my privilege\" is that it means to have an awareness of the political and historical reality that I was born into and have grown up in. Life experience is the means by which we evolve as people; our opinions, words, actions, and thoughts are all defined by our perception of ourselves and our place in the world. That perception is undeniably linked to the historical and political context in which we exist. When you are told to \"check your privilege,\" you are being told to open your eyes to the reality of your situation, to the way that society treats you, compared to how it treats others. In other words, realize that your experience is unique, and that the opinions of others are no more or less valuable than yours, regardless of social status. This concept makes white people uncomfortable, as we have rigged the societal system so effectively to our own benefit. They would prefer to ignore the advantages they have over others. As a result, \"checking one\\'s privilege\" becomes an attack on the comfort of white america in the cozy little system of oppression it has created for itself. \\n\\nTL;DR: Checking your privilege doesn\\'t mean that being white, or a guy, or straight, or whatever discredits your accomplishments and opinions, just that individuals should have an understanding of the reality in which they exist, and how that reality affects them and others.\\n\\nEdit: for the sake of context, I am a 20 yr old straight white dude, same as the Princeton kid.', 'op-title': 'CMV: The \"check your privilege\" phenomenon is not racist against white people; rather, it calls for an awareness of the cultural and historical reality in which we live.', 'pair_ids': ['p_1243'], 'train': 1})}),\n",

But I\\'m extremely discouraged because I\\'m essentially failing at everything but math. The main issue is that my parents are not really a part of my education; I do it on my own. I\\'m fine with this, except that I really detest the chemistry course I\\'m supposed to have been doing this year (I haven\\'t even been able to pass any of the later tests), and my history/literature syllabus is really vague and I haven\\'t learned a thing.\\n\\nAlso, I\\'ve never been taught how to write a paper. All my attempts have been pretty awful, and I can never seem to scrounge up enough stuff to write about. I don\\'t believe I\\'m actually that bad at writing, it\\'s just that I never write papers about any subject I know anything about.\\n\\nI\\'ve talked to my mom multiple times about these issues, and she always just kind of says, \"Hmm, well your sister did all right with it\". (I have a sister who\\'s a grade above me, also homeschooling).\\n\\nThe fact is, I hate chemistry. I greatly respect it, and I understand it is a useful subject to learn... *if you plan on making a career out of it*, which I don\\'t. Which brings me to my next point.\\n\\nWhat I enjoy doing and learning about is 3D modeling and rendering. I use Blender and I\\'ve learned a bunch and gotten good with it. But this counts for absolutely none of my school credit. I have to learn some science that I have essentially zero use for, and won\\'t even fully understand or remember anyway. Algebra I actually get, and it happens to be a little relevant to programming and 3D graphics. Maybe not as much as geometry, but I\\'ll be doing that next year and I\\'m not worried about it.\\n\\nBut I don\\'t remember a bit of the biology I supposedly learned last year, and it looks like my chemistry has gone the same route. I really do *want* to understand chemistry, at least enough to make a passing grade so that I can graduate high school. But I\\'ve tried online courses, and none of it has really \"clicked\". The problem is *partly* that my text book explains things really crappily, but it\\'s also that I just don\\'t care for chemistry. At all.\\n\\nI hear physics won\\'t be as bad, and I\\'m sort of looking forward to it. Technically I don\\'t even have to do both chemistry and physics; just one or the other. I wish I could just give up on chemistry, go ahead and start physics over the summer so I\\'m not an entire year behind, and not be judged and frowned upon for not learning this rather irrelevant science.\\n\\nSo, the bottom line is, I feel confident about what I want to learn about and do with my life, but apparently it\\'s not OK to learn just the subjects that will be relevant to me and my life. I hear that the education system didn\\'t used to be like this, and that high school used to actually prepare you for a career. I absolutely wish this was the way it was.\\n\\nOne more thing, I am posting to /r/changemyview, but this could very well have also been posted to some kind of advice subreddit. I\\'d love it if you could change my view, but to do that you\\'re going to have to convince me that I\\'ll even be able to graduate, because as it is, my high school education in the eyes of my family (if they even knew how behind I was) would be a huge crumbled mess.\\n\\nWell this has basically been a stream of my thoughts and hasn\\'t been edited for nice readability.

It was a bit disconcerting, but I held onto my intellect and pursued the wisdom of great men and women to try to figure out what was what.\\n\\nI came to the conclusion that, while nihilism is certainly a plausible world view, I simply couldn\\'t accept it. I also decided that the concepts of \"heaven\" and \"hell\" were too similar. They\\'re both prisons.

If the universe is a truly hard-determenistic system, then it might be possible for the human race to literally build heaven, and bring back from the dead anyone who ever lived. All you need are the data, and you can reconstruct anything.\\n\\nIt might even be possible for us to overcome that pesky heat-death time limit. I know these theories sound way out-there, but I honestly believe the human race has the capability, and the obligation, to rely on it\\'s own powers. The only other option is to trust God (or the Gods) which is tantamount to giving up. We weren\\'t created (or evolved) to let somebody else save us. Humans have been overcoming physical obstacles for millenia, without any supernatural help. Let\\'s continue doing that.\\n\\n----\\n\\nEdit 1: To add a few notes and clarifications:\\n\\n1) my definition of \"heaven.\" - One of two desinations in the afterlife, in which \"believers\" or \"the good ones\" are allowed to live in infinite happiness and peace, completely in allignment with the will of \"God the creator,\" for eternity.\\n\\n2) My definition of \"God.\" (if one exists) - The ultimate being, creator of everything (except itself). Attributes: omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, essential goodness. This precludes that the creator must be a conscious being, not merely a force or energy. \\n\\n3) Supervenience theory says that large systems are limited in the types of qualities they can have by the qualities of the parts they\\'re made of. This means that consciousness can only be the result of two things, (A) a \"minutely conscious\" universal substrate, or (B) a supernatural realm from which our consciousness is \"peering in\" on the physical realm.\\n\\n4) in case (A), our consciousness is merely the result of the universe producing sufficiently complex structures, and therefore we are all part of one universal mind, which will die in the heat-death if we don\\'t find some way of overcoming that obstacle.\\n\\n5) in case (B), there exists some supernatural realm to which we may or may not go when we die. That supernatural realm may or may not simply be \"another world\" or some sort of waiting room before we go to heaven or hell.\\n\\nEdit 2: \\n\\nI said:\\n\\n&gt;Humans have been overcoming physical obstacles for millenia, without any supernatural help.\\n\\nThis was too bold a statement. While God may or may not have contributed to humanities success, my belief is that we shouldn\\'t rely on his help forever. While I\\'m certainly ok with people using belief in God as a \"mental crutch\" (please ignore the negative connotations), I think humanities ultimate destiny is to learn how to make it\\'s own decisions, without the help of it\\'s original creator. If there is no creator, then my view is still equally valid.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We\\'d just like to remind you of a couple of things.

In heroic defeats, the losing side at least gets to go down with honor, dignity, and glory, whereas a blundering victory usually just serves as another example in highlighting the horror and incompetence of war. \\n\\nThis is a hard case to argue, I understand, as many people (understandably) are against war in general. However, I believe that as humans, warfare is an inevitable part of our existence, and if it\\'s going to occur, we may as well accept that the examples of glory and bravery displayed in battles showcases an enlightening side of the human spirit. However, I must preface that I\\'m discussing this from a philosophical, poetic point of view. I accept that realistically, a \\'defeat\\' is almost never a good thing for the army being defeated, however I am arguing it is better, for both sides, than a blundering victory.\\n\\nLook to the first Battle of Thermopylae, where the 300 Spartans infamously held off the combined might of the Persian empire for three days before succumbing to treachery and meeting a glorious death. Though the 300 were eventually felled, the battle remains one of the most celebrated in history, and serves as the locus classicus of the heroic last stand. \\n\\nCompare such an inspiring, rousing event to the blundering victory of the Soviet Union in their repelling of Germany\\'s Operation Barbarossa. Germany had all the advantages, however with the coming of winter, their forces were entirely crippled, and so they found themselves slaughtered by Red Army forces. There are over a million casualties recorded in the Battle of Moscow alone, many due to the blundering, accidental nature of the Soviet victory. \\n\\nIn the case of the 300 Spartans, humanity has clearly benefited from their displayable of such great bravery - We\\'ve gained literature, films, music and stories from the battle. At the same time, the Spartans who died to make such a thing possible have gone down as some of history\\'s greatest warriors. \\n\\nMeanwhile, in my example of Barbarossa, millions were slaughtered in an accidental, largely environmentally caused victory, and nobody was remembered. \\n\\nIn Thermopylae, the Persians gained traditionally \\'victory\\', while the Spartans gained glory and a place in history\\'s metaphorical wall of fame. In Barbarossa, due to the coincidental aid of winter working against German forces, they were able to scrape a victory, though there are scarce tales of glory and heroism told concerning the event. \\n\\nPlease understand I\\'m not using these battles as *evidence* for my argument per se, but merely to help you understand where I\\'m coming from in this belief.  \\n\\nI know it\\'s a controversial belief, but the way I see it, the inspiration gained, and glory displayed by humanity in heroic defeats outweighs the short term benefits gained by one side in a blundering victory.\\n\\nGeorge S. Patton said \"Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best; it removes all that is base. All men are afraid in battle. The coward is the one who lets his fear overcome his sense of duty.

We are all familiar with the phenomenon of late posts getting buried and early posts remaining at the top of the thread.  This phenomenon is the direct result of the fact that most people only read the first few comments in a thread combined with the fact that people tend to upvote significantly more than they downvote.\\n\\nLet me use a hypothetical example to explain my point.  Imagine there is a 5 hour old thread with 100 comments in it and the top five comments are all mediocre comments that 50% of people who read them upvote.  Then someone posts an extremely high quality comment that over 90% of people who read it upvote.  This comment starts with 1 upvote so it is at position 70 or so out of the 100 comments.  So after a couple hours 1000 people view the comments, 100% of them view the first five comments and only about 2% of them view the 70th comment.  So the top five mediocre comments would get upvotes from 50% of the 1000 people (500 upvotes) and the amazing post at position 70 would get upvotes form 90% of the people who read it (18 upvotes).  I hope this illustrates how, in a world where people only use upvotes and not downvotes, top posts will tend to remain at the top even if they are only moderately good comments while great comments that are posted late will tend to remain near the middle or bottom (unless they are linked to by /r/bestof or something).\\n\\nI think we can all agree that it is more desirable to have comments sorted by perceived quality than by some other arbitrary method (how early you posted).  If instead of only using upvotes, people used downvotes just as frequently, this problem is greatly improved.  In the same example as before let’s assume that everyone votes, up or down, on every post they read.  So instead of just not upvoting the posts that they feel don’t deserve an upvote, they downvote it.  In this situation, 50% of people would upvote the top five posts and 50% of people would downvote them, so even though only 2% of people actually go down the list to read the high quality 70th post, its upvote count will still rise faster than the top five mediocre posts.\\n\\nI believe that in a subreddit such as /r/CMV you should not downvote opinions just because you disagree with them, but I also think that you shouldn’t upvote comments just because you agree with them for the same reason.  You should upvote comments that you feel are of high quality and downvote comments you feel are of low quality.  We want the comments to be sorted from best to worst so that when someone visits a thread they will be confronted with the most compelling arguments first.\\n\\nSo that is why I think it is misguided for the mods of /r/CMV to encourage people to not downvote posts *in general*.  I totally support them asking people to not vote just based on whether they agree or disagree with someone, but I think people should vote both up and down based on how compelling they feel the argument is.\\n\\nI’m going to preempt a few concerns here:\\n\\n1) Downvoting discourages people from voicing unpopular opinions.\\n\\nFirst off, I don’t think you should downvote an opinion for being unpopular, but only if you think it is a bad argument (i.e. it is a logical fallacy or it makes some assertions that are objectively wrong, like if they claimed that we shouldn’t invade Iran because it’s in South America).  Secondly, I think it’s more important to sort comments properly than to worry about people’s feelings getting hurt from negative karma.  I think if you are avoiding posting things because you are worried about a negative karma score, that is pretty ridiculous.\\n\\n\\n2) Even if most people think a comment is low quality, that doesn’t mean everyone will think so.  By downvoting comments that the majority of people find low quality, you are making it less likely that someone who might find it compelling will see it.\\n\\nYou could make the same argument against sorting it by upvotes only.  “Just because the majority of people consider a post to be high quality doesn’t mean everyone will and by allowing the highest upvoted comments to rise to the top you are pushing the less popular posts to the bottom making them less likely to be seen by someone who isn’t convinced by the popular arguments.”  I think if you want to make this argument, you can’t just make it against downvotes, but against sorting by perceived quality in general.\\n\\n\\n3) If people downvote OP’s comments, he/she won’t get as many responses so it will be harder to change their view.\\n\\nI agree 100% with this and you should never downvote OP’s comments in their own thread.  But if you aren’t the OP, then I think it is better to address the most compelling arguments.\\n\\n\\n4)  It is better to report arguments that break the rules than to downvote them.\\n\\nI am not talking about comments that violate the rules.  I am talking about totally legitimate comments that address the topic with real questions and concerns.  But if there are a lot of really great comments, they should be sorted in a logical way with the best comments first and the worst comments last.  Yes, you should report any comments that violate the rules.  Other than that, you should upvote comments you find especially good and downvote comments you find especially bad.  Maybe there are two comments making the same point but one does so with referenced sources and the other does so without sources and in a confusing or arrogant way.  So upvote the better one and downvote the worse one even though neither of them needs to be reported.\\n\\n\\n**EDIT**:  I'd also like to add that I don't think there is really any value in downvoting people into the negatives unless they are trolling.  I can see how that would be disheartening to people trying to contribute while not really adding anything to the sorting.  I would suggest that people down't downvote comments that are made in good faith that are already at 0.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

While this statement was obviously just pandering to a knee jerk emotional reaction to the idea of bestiality, the reaction from the GRA (Gay rights activists) was surprising. While some lip service was payed to consent, the emotion of the responses seemed to sum up as \"Bestiality is disgusting to me, and homosexuality is not. Therefore the comparison is invalid and offensive.\" The consent idea was more of a rationalization and an afterthought. Now consent for animals is doubtful to say the least, thats not where the outrage was coming from.\\n\\nBut as I looked into it a far more clear example of hypocrisy emerged: Polygamy. Consider [this article](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2006/03/dont_do_unto_others.html), which attempts to distance gay rights from legalized polygamy. In particular this quote \"Here\\'s the answer. The number isn\\'t two. It\\'s one. . . Second, the number isn\\'t arbitrary. **It\\'s based on human nature**.\" (Emphasis mine) Imagine that argument being used on gay marriage. Nowadays you\\'d rightly get laughed out of the building. How about the fourth entry on [this otherwise correct article](http://www.mibba.com/Articles/Politics/4522/Debunking-Five-Arguments-Against-Same-Sex-Marriage/), which says the idea of marrying whomever you want is \"childish\". Hows that for marriage equality? [Another one](http://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2012/10/marriage-equality-not-slippery-slope), that compares polygamy to pedophilia (12 year olds cannot consent) in the second paragraph, using the same cheap shot he\\'s criticizing. This shows the thought process behind all this: they think about sexuality and law just the same way conservative evangelicals do. They consider sexuality they approve of to be worthy of being legal, and scorn sexuality they find disgusting or \"wrong\". \\n\\n\\nI\\'m not a polygamist nor do I want to be one, but I recognize that social change is constant and GRA are not as high-and-mighty as they think. When the new social issues come up **they** will be the ones with the bigotry, and **they** will be the ones \"standing in the doorway, blocking up the hall\".\\n\\nBt then again this all is making me agree with [Rick Santorum](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/post/rick-santorum-compares-same-sex-marriage-to-polygamy-in-spirited-exchange-at-nh-college/2012/01/05/gIQAdEwXdP_blog.html) and [Mike Huckabee](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/mike-huckabee-gay-marriage-polygamy_n_3530188.html), so please, CMV!\\n\\nEDIT: While polygamy is an interesting debate, I brought that up as an example of a larger pattern of emotional thinking about sexuality and law. To CMV, show my interpretation of the gay rights movement is bunk. \\n\\nEDIT 2: A couple of people have brought up incest, and see several connections to what I was talking about with polygamy. The argument against polygamy from GRAs boils down to 2 points. 1. A father marrying an underage daughter is wrong. This is covered by existing age-consent and coercion laws. 2. It increases the likelihood of genetic disease. I see this a phoned-in and tying in with my earlier point about rationalizing an emotional bias. No one who advocated argument 2 wants to ban 40yo mothers from having kids or anyone with inheritable \"bad\" genes. Just another case of hypocrisy and emotional thinking about sexuality and law. \\n\\nEDIT 3: Anyone mentioning the marrying of underage people is missing the point in several ways. First of all, thats a non-issue as such things are already covered by existing laws on consent and coercion. Saying incest and underage marriage is wrong because incest is wrong is missing the real issue. Second of all the point Im trying to make is more than if polygamy is right or wrong, is that the way of thinking that most people including the GRA community isnt consistent. Its conflating personal taste with legality. Thats the problem. By bringing up underage marriage to emotional charge what you are saying to appeal to people\\'s disgust with pedophilia is a perfect example of whats wrong. \\n\\nEDIT 4: We have a changed view. /u/DocTorrFabulous persuaded me to not generalize the community based on a few negative experiences. I still hold to my thoughts about the hypocrisy, but not its prevalence. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It makes me really really sick. So I’m going to say something about it. One thing I have heard ad nauseum is that this is not censorship because the government didn’t do it. I don’t understand why so many people say this. It doesn’t have to be government censorship to be censorship. If anyone silences anyone because what they said pissed someone off, they censored them. It may not be illegal or a first amendment issue, but it is censorship. Moreover, we live in a country where corporations run everything and have the government at their beck and call and vice versa. The two are fucking each other in the fetid cunt all day long. So in that world it doesn’t really matter who wielded the axe.This is what I think. Speech does have repercussions. But the repercussions should be other speech in opposition. Not silencing. He should have been, and was, chastised, objected to, humiliated, and forced to defend or recant his words (he chose recant) but not silenced.

I\\'ve never been one for the \"console war\", and I consider fanboyism foolish. I\\'ve owned most consoles from all the major manufacturers since the late 1980\\'s and have been a PC gamer since the late 90\\'s. In all my time gaming, whilst there have been bad consoles sure (Virtual Boy anyone), none have felt quite as useless and pathetic as the Xbox One to me; after all, even the Virtual Boy was an experiment into new technology. It didn\\'t work but it was trying at least...\\n\\nYou see, I genuinely hate the Xbox One. I hate what it represents, I hate what it champions in the industry, I hate it\\'s build quality; and this really bothers me. I\\'d hate to think of myself as a mindless \"hater\" or \"fanboy\", and clearly there must be reasons people own an Xbox One or they wouldn\\'t have bought them, but I cannot place these reasons. I\\'ll go through all the points I can consider and explain my reasoning.\\n\\n1. TV/Apps - All these apps; Netflix, Skype etc. are already available on pretty much everything else. My PS3 can play blu-rays and Netflix and it\\'s 8 foot away, I don\\'t need another console or this. Why would I buy a new console for something I can already do on my PC, Phone, Tablet and multiple consoles I already own. More specifically, why would anyone buy an Xbox One for this. If you want Netflix, buy one of those cable boxes for like £40, or a last-gen console like the PS3/360. Not only do you get Netflix but you also don\\'t need to pay for Xbox Live Gold on top of an expensive console.\\n\\n2. Exclusives - Ryse, Fighter Within, Xbox Fitness... does anyone actually care? I\\'m being serious. They all appear to be either kinect games, sports games, or both. Only Ryse breaks the trend and that\\'s a poor mans God Of War with excessive quick time events and bloody microtransactions, so it couldn\\'t be more worthless in my mind.\\n\\n3. Big Franchises - Dead Rising 3 is an exclusive... but zombies are so overdone now, and I\\'ve still not even played Dead Rising 2 properly. Worse still, it looks like they\\'ve taken away the zany fun to make it more \"gritty\" like every other game out there. There\\'s Forza I guess, but I can play the last Forza game on my 360 and it has more content. Titanfall, not really my thing, but if I wanted to play it I\\'d do so on my PC or I can get it on my 360; same with Assassin\\'s Creed, Call Of Duty, or anything else that\\'s come out recently.\\n\\n4. Next Gen Experiences - Like what? All the so called next gen experiences look like last gen games with maybe a little more polish. There\\'s nothing that makes me feel wowed; all it seems they\\'re doing is adding an \"open world\" to everything. Witcher 3; \"Open World\", Metal Gear Solid V; \"Open World\", Dragon Age: Inquisition; \"Open World\". Add in all the games which are sandbox games by design which would necessitate being open world such as Watch_Dogs, Batman: Arkham Knight, GTA V etc. and it quickly becomes all we\\'re getting. Does everything have to be open world now? Seriously, did anyone think racing games like Need For Speed or The Crew needed to be open world? Sure I like a sandbox game on occasion but I do actually like linear, tightly scripted games as well.\\n\\n5. Upcoming Exclusives - Such as? Seriously there\\'s nothing coming. There\\'s likely a Halo game and a Gears Of War game in the works, and that\\'s it really... and I have them already on Xbox 360, I\\'m not paying for them again. The stories where both concluded, stop milking the franchises with unnecessary sequels. Then there\\'s Fable Legends which isn\\'t even slightly interesting after they butchered the franchise previously on 360, and Quantum Break which looks like flashy crap much like Beyond: Two Souls and Heavy Rain, games with no actual gameplay that play like piss-poor movies. There\\'s nothing here worth noting.\\n\\n6. Multiplatform Games - Sure there may be an excess of open world games, but I\\'m still excited to play things like Batman: Arkham Knight and Witcher 3, then there\\'s games like The Evil Within, Final Fantasy XV, and Cyberpunk 2077 which all look incredible... but why would I ever choose the Xbox One for these games? The PS4 will play them smoother and at a higher resolution, and the PS4 actually has exclusives I\\'m interested in like The Order 1886, InFamous: Second Son, and Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends. Likewise the PC will play these games far better too as well as having PC exclusives that consoles simply can\\'t do properly like the Civilization series, Tropico 5, EVE Online and more. The Xbox One just can\\'t compete.\\n\\n7. Corporate Attitude - While the used games and DRM bullshit is behind us, it\\'s only software and it could come back at any time. Add in the locking of everything, even Netflix behind the pay-wall of Xbox Live Gold, and the addition of microtransactions into practically every bloody game they release and Microsoft have made themselves seem extremely anti-consumer. Sure, I know all companies are out to make money, Sony and Nintendo are just as money hungry, but neither of them seem quite so stupid as Microsoft to sabotage their products in the hope of quick cash. I simply don\\'t trust Micro$oft to do anything without trying to bleed my wallet dry in the process.\\n\\nIn the end, I can justify almost any console; even ones I don\\'t like such as the N64. I really like the Wii U because it offers me interesting exclusives unlike the other consoles such as Super Mario 3D World and Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, (other consoles are ignoring platformers it seems), and older games like Deus Ex: Human Revolution have some interesting extra features. The PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, 3DS and PS Vita all have exclusive games I want to play on them. Xbox One simply doesn\\'t.\\n\\nIn short my view of the Xbox One is that it\\'s an overpriced console that does nothing. Every game it can play is better somewhere else, every function it offers is done better somewhere else, and even it\\'s exclusives are mismanaged at best and totally uninteresting and anti-consumer at worst. If I\\'m wrong and there\\'s a reason to own a Xbox One that isn\\'t mindless brand loyalty I\\'d love to hear it. I pride myself on being someone who doesn\\'t fall into the \"console war\" mentality, and if someone genuinely enjoys something I don\\'t, that\\'s fine; but currently I look at what the Xbox One has to offer and what it will offer in the future and I honestly consider anyone who\\'s bought it to have made the wrong decision. It\\'s clearly a bad console... \\n\\nCan you change my view? Do you own an Xbox One and can you justify it for me? I hate feeling like the \"haters\" you get on YouTube childishly saying \"your console sucks\", but I honestly can\\'t see the value in the Xbox One and it baffles me that anyone would choose this over either a PS4 or a Gaming PC.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I strongly believe in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and if you\\'re not hurting anyone, then you get your freak on and be whoever you are.  \\n\\nHowever, the labels are getting to be a bit too much.  I agree with a sentiment that I see all over the CMV sub:  a lot of these labels are created by attention seekers who can\\'t stand to be part of an already defined group and must create their own category.  No amount of evidence, arguing, diversity seminars or PowerPoint slide presentations will convince me that there\\'s a difference between bisexual and Pansexual.  However, I have no dog in this fight.  I am a straight male who happy being a male and doing manly things.  \\n\\nFirst, it was LGBT.  Then it was LGBTQ.  Now it\\'s LGBTQIA.  Again, not my concern.  They can use as many letters and/or labels as they want.  However, I find the use of the term \"cisgendered\" or \"cissexual\" to be ridiculous.  It is an unnecessary term.\\n\\n[According to The Williams Institute](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/williams-institute-report-reveals-million-gay-bisexual-transgender/story?id=13320565), approximately 4% of the population classifies themselves as LGBT.  That leaves 96% who do not.  I do not know the validity of this number and I\\'m sure there is a range of agreed upon statistics.  \\n\\nIn my opinion, cisgendered or cissexual is the \"default\" setting.  Those with alternate sexual or gender identities are the minority.  That in no way suggests or implies that they are bad or wrong.  There are simply less of them.  I think it\\'s rather safe to assume that someone is cis unless they tell me otherwise.  If they want me to know that they fall into a different category (or even a variety of different categories) then I assume that they will tell me.  I do subscribe to the rather antiquated notion that what you prefer to do in the bedroom is your own business and doesn\\'t need to be broadcasted, but that\\'s just me.\\n\\n[Polydactyly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydactyly) exists.  It affects a small portion of the population and thus, there is a label or designation for it.  In no way is this label meant to shame or degrade those with the condition.  However, one who is born with no extra fingers or toes does not require a label.  Why?  Because most people have 10 fingers and 10 toes.  It doesn\\'t make them better.  There are just more of them.  Designating someone as \"non-polydactyl\" is ridiculous.\\n\\nThere is a small percentage of the population that is designated as \"special needs\".  This is a broad term that can apply to many different conditions.  Again, the label \"special needs\" in no way is meant to demean them or belittle them.  However, it would be unnecessary to introduce you to my \"regular needs\" friend, Eugene.  \\n\\nSomewhere along the line, \"normal\" became a pseudo-slur.  If I advertise myself as \"just a normal guy\", then I have implied that someone different from me (perhaps, gay or trans) is \"abnormal\".  Now that word does carry a certain air of disgust, even though it\\'s definition simply means \"unusual\" or \"uncommon\".  I would never refer to a person whose gender identity or sexual preference was different than mine as \"abnormal\", but I find it confusing that some folks get angry if it\\'s implied that they are part of a smaller group.\\n\\n\"Minority\" carries a lesser degree of the same stigma.  \"Minority\" just means you\\'re part of a smaller group.  By definition, left-handed people are a minority (roughly 11%).  However, if you informed 100 left handed people that they were in a minority, I find it difficult to believe that any one of them would be offended.\\n\\nPatton Oswalt had a great bit about watching a group of kids playing some elaborate game with all sorts of rules and regulations.  \\n\\n*So they would say: \"Okay, uh, the bike path over at the skaffetys\\' is lava and if you touch that, you\\'re dead.  And then the hedges over at the slingerlands\\' are poison snakes...and if you go over there they\\'ll bite you and you\\'re dead.*\\n\\nOne of the kids proclaims Patton to be dead because he touched the bike path and the bike path is lava.  He then has to explain that he\\'s not playing and the lava rule doesn\\'t really apply to him.  That\\'s exactly how I feel.  I\\'m not playing. \\n\\nI don\\'t need someone else to give me a label because I don\\'t fit into a smaller group.    \\n\\nFeel free to change my view, but be aware that any replies lambasting my \"cis privilege\" will be completely ignored.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit:  ok.  I learned quite a bit today.  I tend to think in terms of black and white and lesser in shades of grey.  In short, the \"cis\" term isn\\'t so much a label that was made up for the sake of yet another label, but as a needed term for when those with gender and sexual diversity have a discussion that warrants it.  \\n\\nPart of my issue was/is that I never really interact with much diversity.  I have a few gay, lesbian and bi friends and while it\\'s not a secret, that characteristic just doesn\\'t come up in conversation.  The few people that I\\'ve met that do exhibit some gender diversity or otherwise \"unique\" sexual preferences were absolutely unbearable.  They waved it around like a big obnoxious flag, thoroughly daring anyone to try and ignore them.\\n\\nThanks everybody.  I do have some comments to delta and I will do that tonight.

A stated reason for the Second Amendment is to resist tyranny, but I don't think that is possible in this day and age, as the modern US military would crush any resistance, as they have the best tanks in the world (try shooting an Abrams) and the best air force. not to mention that few would seriously take up arms in America, as we have it far too good. in the end, i do not believe there is a valid reason for the second amendment, as weapons such as assault rifles are pretty much unnecessary and even a liability, as they have been used for horrible tragedies, such as Sandy Hook and Aurora \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I think this applies to all elections, but to explain myself I'll just give a single example.

My opinions on Ron himself aside, voting for a libertarian presidential candidate was a waste of a vote for anyone who chose to do so. I believe that anyone who, at least when it got closer to election day, honestly thought that Ron Paul would magically shoot up in ratings and somehow nab the election was either grossly misinformed or simply ignoring the facts in front of them. \\n\\nIt would have been smarter, and I think more pragmatic, to just suck it up and vote for either Romney or Obama. I get it, some people didn't like either of them, but the idea that there really was any more than two options was just an illusion, so it would have been better to vote for whichever you deemed the lesser of two evils, and if you wish, support your choice of third party candidate in other ways so that they perhaps have a better chance next election season. I know this is just one example, but I think the same thinking could apply to any past or future election.

Conscious minds and their states are natural phenomena, of course, fully constrained by the laws of Nature (whatever these turn out to be in the end). Therefore, there must be right and wrong answers to questions of morality and values that potentially fall within the purview of science. On this view, some people and cultures will be right (to a greater or lesser degree), and some will be wrong, with respect to what they deem important in life.\"\\n\\nI guess ultimately this is a very utilitarian moral philosophy, essentially replacing good with wellbeing. I think the concept of wellbeing is much easier to quantify and operationalise than \\'good\\', as good is much more vaguely defined than wellbeing, which looks more at individuals than whole situations. \\n\\nHe answers two initial criticism in his article here http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/a-response-to-critics_b_815742.html \\n\\nI\\'d try to at least flick through the article before replying with an attempting at changing my view. I think he addresses the problems of measuring wellbeing pretty well in the article, and what he calls the persuasion problem as well, although if you think you can expand on the argument go ahead.\\n\\nI\\'ve heard this fellow Sam wants to Nuke all Muslim countries or something, I don\\'t think that, I just think that there is a better way to determine morality than scripture (rubbish), trying to figure out what god wants through observing nature (Aristotle and all western religions as far as I\\'m aware) or just relying on tradition and cultural norms (the only other alternative to science and logic I can think of).\\n\\nI guess pure nihilism is one position you could take (although arguably this is something addressed by Harri in the section on the problem of persuasion) plus I don\\'t think anybody is really a nihilist when it comes to the crunch. \\n\\n\\n**EDIT**\\n\\nI\\'ve included this quote from the article incase you can\\'t read through it\\n\\n\"It seems to me that there are three, distinct challenges put forward thus far:\\n\\n1. There is no scientific basis to say that we should value well-being, our own or anyone else\\'s. (The Value Problem)\\n\\n2. Hence, if someone does not care about well-being, or cares only about his own and not about the well-being of others, there is no way to argue that he is wrong from the point of view of science. (The Persuasion Problem)\\n\\n3. Even if we did agree to grant \"well-being\" primacy in any discussion of morality, it is difficult or impossible to define it with rigor. It is, therefore, impossible to measure well-being scientifically. Thus, there can be no science of morality. (The Measurement Problem)\\n\\nI believe all of these challenges are the product of philosophical confusion. The simplest way to see this is by analogy to medicine and the mysterious quantity we call \"health.\" Let\\'s swap \"morality\" for \"medicine\" and \"well-being\" for \"health\" and see how things look:\\n\\n1. There is no scientific basis to say that we should value health, our own or anyone else\\'s. (The Value Problem)\\n\\n2. Hence, if someone does not care about health, or cares only about his own and not about the health of others, there is no way to argue that he is wrong from the point of view of science. (The Persuasion Problem)\\n\\n3. Even if we did agree to grant \"health\" primacy in any discussion of medicine, it is difficult or impossible to define it with rigor. It is, therefore, impossible to measure health scientifically. Thus, there can be no science of medicine. (The Measurement Problem)\\n\\nWhile the analogy may not be perfect, I maintain that it is good enough to obviate these three criticisms. Is there a Value Problem, with respect to health? Is it unscientific to value health and seek to maximize it within the context of medicine? No. Clearly there are scientific truths to be known about health -- and we can fail to know them, to our great detriment. This is a fact. And yet, it is possible for people to deny this fact, or to have perverse and even self-destructive ideas about how to live. Needless to say, it can be fruitless to argue with such people. Does this mean we have a Persuasion Problem with respect to medicine? No. Christian Scientists, homeopaths, voodoo priests, and the legions of the confused don\\'t get to vote on the principles of medicine. \"Health\" is also hard to define -- and, what is more, the definition keeps changing. There is no clear \"metric\" by which we can measure it, and there may never be one -- because \"health\" is a suitcase term for hundreds, if not thousands, of variables. Is an ability to \"jump very high\" one of them? That depends. What would my doctor think if I wanted a full neurological workup because I can only manage a 30-inch vertical leap? He would think I had lost my mind. However, if I were a professional basketball player who had enjoyed a 40-inch leap every day of his adult life, I would be reporting a sudden, 25 percent decline in my abilities -- not a good sign. Do such contingencies give us a Measurement Problem with respect to health? Do they indicate that medicine will never be a proper science? No. \"Health\" is a loose concept that may always bend and stretch depending on the context -- but there is no question that both it and its context exist within an underlying reality which we can understand, or fail to understand, with the tools of science. \"\\n\\nI think maybe the biggest flaw with the idea is that it could become a very authoritarian philosophy. I think that\\'s the real area for discussion.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We\\'d just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I'm going to give two objections to the argument from miracles, one by Hume and one an updated version of Hume's objection by J. L. Mackie given in his book *The Miracle of Theism*.\\n\\nHere is Hume's objection to the argument from miracles, as presented by J. L. Mackie (this is my condensation of Mackie's discussion of Hume, and does not appear in this form in Mackie's book).\\n\\n1. We can determine whether or not to accept a given piece of testimony by considering two things: the credibility of the witness and the intrinsic likelihood of the claim that the witness is making.\\n\\n2. A law of nature is a maximally strong induction from past experience.\\n\\n3. A miracle is a claim that contradicts a law of nature.\\n\\n4. Therefore, a miracle is a claim that contradicts a maximally strong induction from past experience. (from 2 and 3)\\n\\n5. But induction from past experience is the only means we have of evaluating the intrinsic likelihood of an event.\\n\\n6. Therefore, miracles have a very low intrinsic likelihood. (from 4 and 5)\\n\\n7. In practice, the credibility of a witness will never be sufficiently high as to equal or outweigh such a low intrinsic likelihood. There are five reasons for thinking this: (a) miracles are never testified to by sufficiently many people with spotless reputations, excellent educations, and a lot to lose in the event that they are caught lying; (b) people have a tendency to like believing in strange things like miracles and UFOs; (c) miracles usually come from backward nations; (d) the miracles of different religions cancel each other out; and (e) in religious communities, credulity is thought to be a good thing, so they encourage each other to believe more and more in the miracles of their religion.\\n\\n8. Therefore, in practice, we should always reject miraculous claims. (from 1, 6 and 7)\\n\\nMackie sums up Hume's argument from a different perspective as follows:\\n\\n* If the unlikelihood of the testimony's being false is less than the intrinsic unlikelihood of the miracle, then we must reject the miracle report with a confidence corresponding to the difference between the two.\\n\\n* If the unlikelihood of the testimony's being false is equal to the intrinsic unlikelihood of the miracle, then we must suspend judgment.\\n\\n* If the unlikelihood of the testimony's being false is greater than the intrinsic unlikelihood of the miracle, we must accept the miracle, but only with the modest degree of confidence permitted by the difference between the two unlikelihoods.\\n\\nMackie updates Hume's argument as follows (this is more of an inductive inference):\\n\\n1. To establish that a miracle occurred, it is necessary to establish both that the event took place and that it violated the laws of nature.\\n\\n2. Showing that an event violates the laws of nature is a strong reason to think that the event did not occur.\\n\\n3. Showing that an event occurred is a strong reason to think that it did not violate the laws of nature.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the atheist will always be able to object to the argument from miracles by arguing either that the event must not have occurred or that the event must not have violated the laws of nature. (Which one we use will depend on the specific alleged miracle under discussion - if the miracle is not well supported, then the former tactic is stronger, and if the miracle is well supported, then the latter tactic is stronger.)\\n\\n5. Therefore, in practice, the theist will never be able to establish that a miracle occurred.\\n\\nMackie notes that this reasoning even applies to miracles which one has witnessed for oneself. The miracle that you have witness might not really have occurred, since you might have misperceived something, been tricked by a magician, or deluded yourself about what you saw over a period of time. Alternatively, the event you witness might have occurred in accordance with the laws of nature after all.\\n\\nTo change my view about this, you will have to show that Hume's argument and Mackie's argument both fail.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It would make scheduling easier, business meetings would be smoother, and there\\'d be much less confusion when travelling and trying to synchronise things between countries. It wouldn\\'t make any difference to sleep cycles or work hours or anything like that. We would also abolish daylight saving time.\\n\\nWhat I\\'m **not** suggesting is that the world all wake up at the same time and go to work at the same time. \\n\\nLet\\'s say that we agree on GMT as the world\\'s timezone (although it doesn\\'t matter which time we choose). London would wake up at about 7am, work from 9am - 5pm, and go to sleep at about 10pm. The sun would rise at about 7am and would set at about 8pm. New York, however, are 5 hours behind London, so the sun would rise there at 2am on the universal clock. This doesn\\'t affect anything though, because they\\'d wake up at 2am, go to work from 4am - 12pm, and go to bed at 5pm. They\\'d still get up when the sun rises and go to bed when the sun sets, but *the only difference would be the number they read off the clock*. They\\'d still have the same sleeping pattern and working hours, and they\\'d get used to it in a matter of weeks. Instead of waking up and reading the time as 7am, they\\'d wake up *at the same time* and read the clock as 2am. All that would change is what time they consider nighttime. Sydney, meanwhile, are 9 hours in front of London - they wake up when the sun rises at 4pm, they work from 6pm - 2am, see the sun set at 5am, and go to sleep at 7am. It seems weird that they should go to sleep at 7am, but to them it would be the correct time! They\\'d still be going to sleep shortly after sunset, like the rest of the world, and would go to sleep right on schedule at the same time they would now. They\\'d just call the time they go to bed 7am rather than 10pm. *The only difference is the time they read off the clock*\\n\\nThe times used above are obviously an arbitrary template used to demonstrate my argument. \\n\\nThis would synchronise the world, so if you want to skype your friend in Sydney from London, you can just say \"I\\'ll call you at 4am\" and he\\'ll know exactly when to expect your call. The same goes for business meetings etc. Scheduling in general becomes so much easier. It doesn\\'t solve problems like jet lag, because when you travel you still have to adapt to the physical difference in location on the planet. It also makes programming a hell of a lot easier, because [timezones are a nightmare to program properly](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDEQtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-5wpm-gesOY&amp;ei=4_ZaU5CrH8Pa0QXKx4GgAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6DVexJDKjhP6pNTh0eUdJhX92kw&amp;sig2=ArIuYmzIDvn79AdM5OBtjw). It can also make contracts easier, because if any one person says that something should start at exactly 12am, nobody disagrees about what time that is and there\\'s so much less confusion.\\n\\nI think it\\'s a good idea, but I\\'ve never met anyone who agrees with me, but I\\'ve also never met anyone who\\'s presented a convincing counter-argument.

Granted, older consoles used chips often found in PC\\'s (the NES\\'s CPU was based off the design of the one used in the Apple II and C64, Genesis used the Zilog Z80 And Motorola 68K, ect.) but they produced results that greatly differed from one another in terms of processing, sound and graphics. But with this current gen, both the Xbox One and PS4 use the same micro-architecture (x86) in their APU\\'s that are manufactured by the same company, AMD, that is used in current PC\\'s today. Many of both consoles\\' non-exclusives have also been shown to underperform graphically when pitted against desktops made for the same price as them.\\n\\n\\nThe other point that I feel no longer separates consoles and PC\\'s is their firmware and the need to constantly update it as well as patch games via internet. Again, with older consoles, if I put a functioning copy of Super Metroid in any working SNES, it should play immediately, and that\\'s it. I can understand with the 6th Generation\\'s addition with a UI to adjust the clock, manage saves and other basic functions, but when there were additions like internet browsers, multimedia players, Streaming Video, and other services that added nothing to one\\'s gameplay experiences, it seemed like a waste of resources, and redundant when my computer can do the same things.\\n\\nAnd on the subject of online patches, I\\'d like to give another example concerning cartridge-based games. Sure, there were rereleases of patched games, like Final Fantasy 6 fixing a bug with a character\\'s common skill or one of the Shinobi games taking out the blatant copyright infringing characters or Ocarina of Time\\'s removal of bugs and Islamic references. But most times, the game you bought was the game you got. Now, we have to add storage devices to hold all the revisions of Skyrim, Borderlands, and Halo; a similar issue PC users have to deal with.\\n\\n\\nAnother small point is that of maintenance. Ignoring that older consoles last longer due to simpler internals and arguably more durable designs, 360\\'s are imfamous for their Red Ring of Death errors. And if it wasn\\'t covered under warranty, and you don\\'t have the specific parts to fix it, you may be SOL. And yes, it is possible to for PC\\'s to be totaled for numerous reasons. However, you can more easily test components to see which could be salvaged, and which need replaced, and you have plenty of different makes and models to choose from.\\n\\n\\nI realize that in this argument, I may failed to avoid the \"PC Master Race\" circlejerk enticement.

In this thread, I\\'ll defend the tenability of a position on the mind-body problem called dualism. I would like the main emphasis in this thread to be on the debate between dualism and materialism, although other theories of mind like panpsychism are welcome as well.\\n\\nDualism is the position that the mind is immaterial. There are two main kinds of dualism:\\n\\n1. Substance dualism - This is the position that the mind is an immaterial thing distinct from the brain. This position is defended primarily by religious philosophers and has generally fallen out of favor in contemporary philosophy. Descartes is the philosopher most associated with this position, but it has modern defenders like Richard Swinburne.\\n\\n2. Property dualism - This is the position that the mind is an immaterial property of the brain. This position is much more popular than substance dualism and is defended by secular philosophers like David Chalmers. (I think property dualism is more tenable than substance dualism.)\\n\\nThe most widely held competitor to dualism is materialism, which holds that the mind is material. There are a number of forms of materialism as well, ranging from the unsophisticated identity theory (mental states are identical to physical processes in the brain) to the more fashionable functionalism (mental states are identical to the functional roles of brain states in the system of brain states). Perhaps the most prominent defender of functionalism is Daniel Dennett.\\n\\nI think that dualism is a tenable position in philosophy of mind - in other words, there is nothing obviously irrational about it, there are arguments for it that don\\'t make any clear blunders, and a reasonable person could arrive at this conclusion. This is a very modest claim that I suspect even most materialist philosophers would accept.\\n\\nI think there are two arguments that make it reasonable to be a dualist.\\n\\nMy first argument for dualism is that we have qualia. Qualia are subjective, private, first person experiences; they are \"what it is like\" to be in a certain state. If I look at a white wall in my room, there are photons registering in my eyes and chemical events going on in my brain, but there is also something it is like to be looking at the white wall, a white quale.\\n\\nIt is difficult to see how the qualia in my example could be identical to the chemical events going on in my brain, because we can always ask why any given chemical process is accompanied by qualia. To give another example, stimulation of the C-fibers is always accompanied by pain qualia, but it seems reasonable enough to ask why stimulation of the C-fibers has to be accompanied by qualia. I do not mean to imply that these questions have no answers. I am just saying that the fact that it is reasonable to ask them suggests that qualia are not literally identical to any physical event.\\n\\nChalmers brings this point out by means of his zombie thought experiment in his book *The Conscious Mind*. We can conceive of a world exactly like ours in every physical respect, but in which no one has any conscious experience (i.e., any qualia). Since we can conceive of a zombie world, it must be possible, and if it is possible, then qualia are not identical to physical processes.\\n\\nChalmers uses other thought experiments in his book as well. For example, we can conceive of someone who had exactly the same physical makeup as we do having inverted qualia (where we have a red quale, they have a green quale, etc.). This suggests, again, that qualia are not identical to physical events.\\n\\nMy second argument for dualism is that the mind has properties that a physical process cannot have, and physical processes have properties that the mind cannot have. A thought can be apt or witty, but a chemical process cannot. Again, a physical process can have a temperature or velocity, but a thought cannot. This suggests strongly that the mind is not a physical process.\\n\\nSo I think it\\'s clear that dualism is a tenable position that a reasonable person could hold. I don\\'t claim to know that it is true, but it deserves more respect than it often gets on Reddit and elsewhere on the internet. \\n\\nTo change my view about this, you will have to satisfactorily refute my arguments (not just brush them off as materialists are wont to do).\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Most of yoga\\'s moves, for me, seem like bullshit because they place artificial strain on the bodies muscles and joints, akin to hyperextending, which of course is \"difficult,\" but that\\'s only because our bodies aren\\'t designed to bend that way. I would consider myself quite flexible, but some yoga poses seem downright scamworthy due to the way that the strain is applied to your body. It\\'s like a chiropractor who cracks your back and tells you how much \"tension\" you have, which doesn\\'t really do anything since it just requires you to continue to seem them.\\n\\nIt\\'s the same with yoga: after a session, you feel good for a little while, but then it wears off and you end up feeling *worse* if you don\\'t go back again. Placing unnatural and unnecessary strain on the body may make you feel like you \"have a lot to work on,\" but in reality it\\'s because your body isn\\'t designed to bend that way, and would probably benefit just as much from cardiovascular exercise and light stretching.\\n\\nI think it delves further into scam territory due to it being so consumerist. The cheapest membership I found was about $100/month (and they can go *way* up from there, including \"weekend retreats\" that can cost several thousand dollars). You can find a gym membership for $10/month.

There may in fact be more of a net benefit for people\\'s spirituality, from education about our reality than by defending their right to stay wrong. Again, my issue is not with the people who hold the outdated views. The reality is that most adult humans reach adulthood already holding strong views, and won\\'t switch away from them in most circumstances. If they have taken the time to debate with others and look at information regarding their world and tried to come to a rational conclusion, yet decide to still hold on to outdated views, there is not much that any human can do. \\n\\nDefending their right to stay wrong is definitely not a good course of action, as it directly promotes that correctness is not important or valuable in our society.

The middle ground is ignoring them completely, hope their children use the Internet and seek out knowledge and that they aren\\'t making decisions based on their worldview. **The worst case scenario is defending their right to believe whatever they want.** \\n\\nLet\\'s take an example: Bob believes that God is real. He can\\'t really define what God is, but thinking that someone is always watching him feels good. Rebecca tries to explain to him the history of religion, and how the belief in God came from not understanding nature and humans requiring a catch-all to explain things. She explains to him that we now know what the stars are, and that we are actually star material. She explains that praying feels good because introspection is important, and how although there is no \"thing\" watching over him, the beauty of life itself is way cooler anyways.\\n\\nBob thinks about it and decides that although those arguments might make scientific sense they don\\'t make him any happier. Accepting one\\'s place in the cosmos takes too much humility, and instead of working on that, Bob takes the intellectually lazy approach and just stays with good olde God. \\n\\nThe next best outcome is not Rebecca defending his right to hold incorrect views about the world. It\\'s Rebecca not saying anything. **If someone defends that we\\'re allowed to believe whatever we want all it does is promote intellectual laziness, and potentially encourages actually harmful views to materialize and propagate.**\\n\\nEDIT: the responses right now are focusing on the religious aspects and not the actual part I have a problem with: actually defending the right to hold any opinion, no matter how wrong. \\n\\nEDIT 2: thanks for all the comment downvotes instead of voicing your opinions. ;)', 'op-title': 'CMV: Claiming that people are allowed to hold whatever religious views they want implies correctness is not important or valuable in society', 'pair_ids': ['p_1342'], 'train': 1})}),\n",

Often that employee\\'s workload spills over onto his or her co-workers.  \\n\\nThere are plenty of people who have children who have other arrangements in place and are able to work their full shifts, so clearly there must be some kind of acceptable mechanism in place and there\\'s no reason all working parents can\\'t use it.  \\n\\nThe excuse that one needs to leave early to save on childcare expenses is not valid.  Childcare expenses are simply a reality for working parents and it\\'s part of the deal that you accepted when you chose to reproduce.  \\n\\nNote that my argument here is only when this happens on a regular basis.  I don\\'t have a problem with parents using accrued leave in order to leave early for specific events or emergency situations, just like any childless employee would be able to do as well.  \\n\\nThe problem is with parents being allowed to leave early (especially in salary situations, where their pay does not decrease by working fewer hours) and childless co-workers being expected to pick up the slack.\\n\\n\\n* **Parents are always \"not it\" when someone has to work a holiday.**\\n\\nIn the case of 24/7/365 operations, childless employees are much more likely to get stuck working holidays.  Just because an employee is childless doesn\\'t make their holiday plans any less important; they also have families and events that are important to them.  These kinds of work assignments should be rotated fairly regardless of an employee\\'s parental status.\\n\\n\\n* **Bringing your child to work as an alternative to childcare is not okay.**\\n\\nI\\'m not talking about once or twice a year for \"Bring your kid to work day\" or to trick-or-treat at Halloween, I\\'m talking about bringing your kid to work and having them camp out in your workspace for hours at a time.

Even in cities like [Berlin](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-victim-of-its-own-success-berlin-drowns-in-tourist-hordes-and-rising-rents-a-786392.html). We see rent hikes, and gentrification caused by tourism. Holm's research has shown that when Prenzlauer Berg became gentrified, only 20 percent of the original population could afford to stay. Adding insult to injury, [the money earned from tourism may not actually stay in the country, with close to 80% “leaking.”](http://www.unep.org/resourceefficiency/Business/SectoralActivities/Tourism/FactsandFiguresaboutTourism/ImpactsofTourism/EconomicImpactsofTourism/NegativeEconomicImpactsofTourism/tabid/78784/Default.aspx). This may also cause an area to become over-reliant on tourism, which together with the inflation mentioned earlier, will become a vicious cycle. All this makes life harder for the people actually living there.\\n\\nThe traveler sees what he sees, the tourist sees what he has come to see. For my next point, I will bring up [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/xh6i9ZF.jpg) (source is waitbutwhy.com). It's an gross exaggeration, and an extreme one, but get's the point across. Countries will try to put their best foot forward when it comes to tourists. You will not be able to get a good view of a country when you're only visiting amusement parks, beaches, and landmarks that only tourists go to see (I've lived in Auckland all my life and not once have I gone bungy-jumping off the sky tower or the harbour bridge); most tourists don't even speak the language of the country their visiting and have a tourist guide/translator.  The unfortnate result of this is a fake culture that is a caricature of the place that exists solely to rip tourists off (find me a New Yorker that actually calls NY “the big apple”). I'll end this paragraph on a bitter note and invoke the W word: weeaboo.\\n\\nThey treat other countries like their playground, when in reality they're also communities with their own cultures and attitudes. We've all seen tourists standing in the middle of the side walk in a large group, taking pictures of the most mundane things; while the rest of us want to get to school/work. Not everyone in Hawaii is always surfing, not everyone in the Netherlands is stoned all the time, not everyone in Berlin is always partying. We all have mundane lives like you. You can't say you've visited a country until you've lived and worked there for over a year. It is the worst kind of escapism: one where the escape destination is somewhere in the real world, and affect real people.\\n\\nIn short: tourism is the worst kind of gentrification, and tourists are ignorant of the locals, both their lifestyles and their culture.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This events can go from a one person assassination to big massacres with thousands of victims.\\n\\nBut the way that social media treats each one of these cases upsets me. Firstly, a hundred people being killed in a poor country like Pakistan is much more irrelevant that the same amount of victims being killed in a rich country, like France or the USA, but that's not the issue I want to talk about today.\\n\\nI'm going to talk more about the USA in the next paragraph. I know these things happen in other parts of the world, but you know what? Even here in Europe, the USA news seem to be more important that the news related to any other continent or geographic area.\\n\\nSo, since I started watching the news more attentively, I've noticed that there's many gun violence episodes every year in the USA (again, I know this happens in other countries). In fact, I found this on Wikipedia:\\n&gt; In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm.\\n\\nThese numbers are scary, at least for me. I'm absolutely **not** going to discuss whether the US government should or shouldn't take actions about this issue. But I've seen many news about gun shootings, especially in schools. However, many (there are exceptions) of those incidents are forgotten within a week or less .\\n\\nAnd we have bomb explosions. Yes, there are horrendous. Yes, I'm absolutely against people who made it or plan to do it. However, I start to think that the social media consider it much more horrendous that a gun shooting massacre. I'm not saying it'll be preferable to have this or that incident. Both crimes are horrible. But let me give you an example:\\n\\nAlmost a year ago we had the Boston Marathon bomb explosions. Hideous act. But (and I'm going to hell because of what I'm saying) only four people died. I know many people got seriously injured and they didn't deserve that. I'm aware of all that. I'm aware people got scared and they saw their security taken away. I know people in the Boston area got very emotional a year ago because of that event (believe me. Despite living in Europe, I'm a Red Sox fan and I saw that crowd at the tributes). Now, it'll be a year since the explosions happened, and the TVs from my own country will certainly remember us of what happened.\\n\\nBut I remember some gun shootings that hadn't half of the importance of the Boston bombings, even those in which more that 10 people died. Why? Is it because the shootings are supposed to be a normal thing? Is it because the bombs are placed by foreigns who don't like the USA?\\n\\nTL;DR: I think if two criminal incidents have the same amount of victims, they should have the same importance.\\n\\nEDIT: Grammar corrections.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Assertions of \"Feminists hate all men\" and \"You don\\'t understand Feminism\" abound, and it was basically par for the course, however, one post caught my attention: in attempt to show what radical feminism was capable of, a poster quoted from Robin Morgan\\'s essay \"Lesbianism and Feminism: Synonyms or Contradictions?\" (April 4th, 1973) where she states, \"I feel that \\'man-hating\\' is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.\"\\n\\nLet\\'s forget about the first half of that sentence.

Let\\'s say that Jews were used as scapegoats for social ills, deemed genetically inferior, forced to identify themselves publicly or face prosecution, excluded from business and politics and forced to live in ghettos. As a Jew in this scenario, would I not have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing me? If not, why? Is this an extreme example? Getting rid of the actually being mass-murdered thing makes me think it isn\\'t so extreme, and more in line with the sentiment of this quote.\\n\\nWhat about African-Americans? I am not black, but the more I think about it, if I were, I think I would hate white people. Not individual white people, necessarily, but as a class that had actively oppressed my class for so long and (in some views) still continues to do so.\\nAgain, I am not asking you to change my view about what classes are oppressed.

I like, very much, the idea that we wouldn\\'t need a government and that we could make communal decisions in a way that wouldn\\'t involve coercion of anyone or from anyone.  But one thing continues to nag me:\\n\\nUpon the dissolution of the state, how does one prevent the reformation of it, or something like it?\\n\\nIf, in our stateless nation, a coalition of citizens (Coalition A) were to gather together and decide that they were entitled to a percentage of all goods produced in a certain area.  Maybe they\\'re jerks, maybe they did something really great (set up irrigation, maintained a road) and feel that they\\'ve earned this percentage.  Either way, that sounds like taxation, which is a function of government.  This group would be taking from the populace against their will, but they\\'d have enough people to do so by force.  How do you prevent this from happening, as I think it\\'s reasonable that it might?\\n\\nThe only solution I can think of would be to form another, larger coalition comprised those being stolen from (Coalition B); and present a greater show of force to prevent the theft.  But, isn\\'t that just the recreation of a government?  It might be a minimal one, or one that we agree is fair, but a state, nonetheless?  It\\'s activity was definitely coercive, and their prevention of theft was against Coalition A\\'s will for sure (which is a kind of cardinal sin for an Anarchist, as I understand it).  How to you reconcile this situation?  Regardless of how you define Coalition A (a small government or just thieves) they present a problem to the rest of the anarchists.  There\\'s no reason to think that any individual anarchist would be able to put a stop to Coalition A.  And the formation of Coalition B looks a lot like a government Anarchism seems to seek to prevent or eliminate.  This little example is overly simplified, but I feel like any permutation would be subject to the same issue (ie Coalition A maintains a road for a pre-agreed amount of compensation; and the populace then refuses to pay).\\n\\nSo, I realize I may only be displaying my ignorance.  Perhaps I\\'m bringing preconceptions about what Anarchism is or making assumptions about people\\'s behavior that aren\\'t necessarily true.  But, to me, this looks like an enormous logical hole that makes the entire movement impossible.  Is Coalition A or Coalition B actually the goal?  What am I missing here.

Address this point in comments if you have further issues with my opinion.\\n\\nBelow are many questions in need of good answers. Feel free to add your own.\\n\\n&gt; * /u/Code347: \"I guess the first question to answer is: What should all Americans be entitled to as Americans? \\nWhen that is answered, the solution will be fairly easy to come to.\"\\n\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#**Redistribution**\\n\\n(1) **Should we enact a one-time mass-redistribution of wealth? (Moral pros/cons.)**\\n\\n&gt; * /u/FrankP3893: \"I am no expert, but the main problem I have with this is what I can only call \"theft\" from the 1%. These are people and corporations that earned that money in a capitalist country, legally. Poverty is the governments responsibility (legally, morals are a different story but don\\'t forget about philanthropist). It is lazy to see this problem and blame the successful. I think it goes against everything this country stands for.\"\\n\\n&gt; * /u/AllUrMemes: \"As you said, legality and morality are separate things.Nothing the government does is ever illegal. Everything it does is legal. When we drop bombs on innocent foreigners its legal. When we cut food stamps to pay for bank bailouts to preserve executive bonuses, that is legal. Therefore in OP\\'s example, if there was a law that took wealth and redistributed it that would be legal. Not theft.\"\\n\\n&gt; * /u/LeeHyori: \"We are violating people\\'s rights if we are redistributing things that have been justly acquired. However, a lot of what exists today has not been justly acquired, so there is actually a lot of grounds for a reset. However, the reset has to try its best to correct previous injustices. Nozick, I believe, speaks on this as well. This should answer the \"how much should we take from the 1%\" questions as well.\"\\n\\n&gt; * /u/PartyPenguin: \"Let me propose another redistribution to you. I suspect it may change your thinking. What if we were to redistribute ALL the wealth, not just within your prosperous country, but amongst the entire world. Suddenly, you\\'re going to find yourself at a level of destitute poverty that only the homeless of your nation can start to imagine. All of these social justice arguments certainly do apply given the reliance we have on even third world countries propping up our way of life.\"\\n\\n&gt; *One nation at a time, my friend. Once we get America fixed, then we help out the other folks. If you wish to save the world, first put your own house in order.*\\n\\n&gt; * /u/avefelina: \"Your entire argument is based on the false premise that somehow it is wrong to have a rich-poor gap. It\\'s not.\"\\n\\n&gt; *Systems of human behavior are always subject to moral judgement. Perhaps capitalism is inherently evil if the result is that some will be wealthy beyond need and some will be poor to the point of significant deprivation. Or, we can just tweak how we engage in capitalism without necessarily abandoning the whole thing.*\\n\\n&gt; * /u/smellmyawesome: \"A lot of people have this idea that every single wealthy person is like the Koch brothers (just an example of rich people everyone seems to hate). There are plenty of people who worked really hard in school, landed great jobs and currently work 80+ hours a week to make a few hundred thousand dollars a year. Not to mention others who combined a good idea they had with excellent execution and ended up starting what would turn out to be a lucrative business, making them wealthy in the process. But no, fuck those people, give their money to someone else.\"\\n\\n&gt; *...look at how many [people] actually started from nothing and struggled into the 1% by the sweat of their brow, vs those who were born to wealth and leveraged that advantage to become more wealthy. This is not possible for the vast majority of Americans. The \"accident of birth\" is the strongest predictor of financial success. This does not invalidate the inherent value of hard work, but it does negate the myth that hard work and ingenuity alone leads to vast wealth. This is part of the fiction that people are only poor because they are stupid or incompetent or lazy. This is like giving one man a complete set of tools necessary to build a house and another man no tools at all, and then assigning moral failings to the man without tools for being unable to build a house, as if it were a fault in his character and not his lack of tools which was the primary culprit.*\\n\\n(2) **How might a one-time mass-redistribution of wealth be enacted? (Gradually? All at once? Through taxes or direct confiscation?)**\\n\\n&gt; * /u/DagwoodWoo: \"I think that redistributing wealth in one fell swoop could be disastrous. Why not do it gradually by taxing the wealthy to implement the minimum income. Then, any problems which arise can be dealt with.\"\\n\\n&gt; *A gradual system could work as well. I don\\'t know which would really be better though. I do tend to prefer to rip off the band-aid all at once.*\\n\\n&gt; * /u/fancy-free: \"...a better idea is an ongoing but smaller redistribution of wealth. Raising taxes on the rich and paying everyone a flat ~$10k/yr has a proven track record of fixing shitty economies. People take risks on going to college or opening small businesses, because they know that if they go broke it isn\\'t the end of the world.\"\\n\\n&gt; * /u/Spivak: \"What about a different method of accomplishing the same thing? Abolish the current dollar. Issue a new currency evenly amongst the populace but keep current property rights in place. Nothing will be \"stolen\" from anyone but the OP still can enact his reset-act.\"\\n\\n\\n(3) **How much should be taken from the 1%? (What is the reasonable limit on such an action? How far down the scale of \"personal wealth\" is it proper to go? Should this include all property or only cash? What about those whose \"wealth\" is primarily tied up in investments/stocks?)**\\n\\n&gt; * /u/Rainymood_XI: \"...bill gates doesn\\'t have 70b in the bank, but his net worth is around 70b, its his total assets, all of his plusses, not just money.\"\\n\\n&gt; *The 1% has closer to 40% of the total wealth in America (not 99%). My proposal would include divying up their assets/investments and land holdings as well (you are correct that a lot of this \"wealth\" is not directly monetary).*\\n\\n\\n(4) **Would it be most appropriate to divest sole business owners of amassed wealth by specifically dividing ownership/profits of that business to the current employees as opposed to dividing it out to the general public?**\\n\\n(5) **Would it also be necessary to enact caps on how much \"private property\" a person may be allowed to hold (in terms of land ownership/control)?**\\n\\n(6) **What are the likely *intended* results and *unintended* consequences of a one-time mass-redistribution of wealth?**\\n\\n&gt; * /u/Saint_Neckbeard: \"You\\'re assuming that the government would actually give way to the libertarian utopia you\\'re referring to once it got the power to redistribute massive amounts of wealth like this. That is how Stalin justified his expansions of state power.\"\\n\\n&gt; *You raise a significant concern: can \"The Government\" be trusted to enact such a thing?*\\n\\n&gt; * /u/NuclearStudent: \"... Investors and aspiring businessmen don\\'t want to stay in America because of the possibility of more redistributions. If it happens once, there is legal precedent.\" \\n\\n&gt; *I think this may need to be done as an actual Constitutional Amendment that flatly states this is a one time deal, not to be repeated without another Amendment. I think it would be a bad thing to have this happen more than once, for practical reasons, including the one you just proffered.*\\n\\n&gt; * /u/jacquesaustin: \"I think the idea of equality is noble, but again in practice, there are some people who cannot manage anything, they will be broke again.\"\\n\\n&gt; *You are correct that some people are just idiots and \"you can\\'t fix stupid\". I do not believe these persons comprise the majority of the population, meaning this small percentage simply can\\'t ruin it for the rest of us in any meaningful way.*\\n\\n\\n&gt; * /u/mutatron responds to /u/jacquesaustin: \"This in itself is no reason not to do it. Suppose you had 1,000 people, and 2 people owned 40%, and 8 people owned 50%, then the other 990 people owned 10%. Immediately after redistribution everyone would own equal amounts, and then after some months, the bottom 10% say, or the bottom 20% would be back to square one. But still the middle 79% would be better off.\"\\n\\n&gt; * /u/caw81: \"What is the point of redistribution? Lets say you take the 1% and get rid of them... You\\'ve gotten rid of the 1% class of 2014 and now there is another 1% class of 2015. \\n\\n&gt; *The \"New 1%\" would necessarily be a smaller group controlling significantly less wealth with a much smaller gap. This type of mass-redistribution can really only be done once effectively.*\\n\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#**Basic Income**\\n\\n(1) **Should we enact a Basic Income? (Moral pros/cons.)**\\n\\n&gt; * /u/LeeHyori: \"If you want to, you have to do it in a way that doesn\\'t violate people\\'s rights. In my view, the most promising way would be through geolibertarianism. In particular, a citizen\\'s dividend. The way you do this is by inserting universal compensation (note: it is UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME, not usual welfare) into the geolibertarian theory of property rights (i.e. you can own products of your labor but not land, etc.).\"\\n\\n(2) **How would BI be funded and implemented? (Where would the money come from and how would it be collected?)**\\n\\n(3) **How much BI is enough to allow people to live simply while still rewarding work for the \"extras\"? (Should it be a single set amount of cash? A % of GDP? What other metric might be better? )**\\n\\n(4) **Is it necessary to eliminate all other \"social safety net\" programs and convert them all to a single lump-sum under a Basic Income program?**\\n\\n(5) **What are the likely *intended* results and *unintended* consequences of instituting a Basic Income?**\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#**Outlaw Renting**\\n\\nEdit: (4/7/14 19:34) - **Why end Rent?** The ideal of being a landlord is to own multiple properties that are being paid for by someone else. After a time, the mortgages end, but the rental income keeps coming, generating a passive income through control of property. I have lately come to view this as immoral. My ideal is that renting disappear forever, and everyone living in a home be building equity for themselves (not someone else) that can then be taken with them if they move (sell and recoup their investment), or that the paymemts will someday end (paying off the mortgage) allowing them to save for retirement or invest in other new ventures. I see this as beneficial as it will creat a more stable and prosperous society overall, rather than concentrating power and wealth in fewer and fewer hands across generations (leading to 40% of America\\'s wealth in the hands of 1% of the population).\\n\\nImagine a family renting a home and never owning it. Their payments never stop.  They can\\'t save for retirement or afford to send kids to college. All that money they spend on shelter just evaporates (goes to the landlord). With rent abolished, they start making mortgage payments, and after 15years, they stop paying. Now they can save and send their kids to college and help their kids buy homes. Their children have children and sell the original family home, allowing the grandparents to pass on the value they invested to their grandkids, so the grandkids can buy homes and send *their* kids to college. \\n\\nNow imagine everyone doing this. No one gets obscenely wealthy and no one is able to draw merely passive income, but everyone has a home and land within their family. Within three generations we can solve a great many economic and social problems, all by eliminating rent. Our society must stop feeding off itself by chasing some elusive (and immoral) dream of passive income through control of property.\\n\\n(1) **Should we outlaw Renting? (Moral pros/cons.)**\\n\\n&gt; * /u/KrangsQuandary: \"Why rental specifically? Isnt it \"just not right\" that you have to pay for food grown on mother earth? Or you have to pay for tires made from rubber trees that are the sacred inheritance of all mankind?\"\\n\\n&gt; *Paying fair value for a product is not wrong. You grow the food with your labor and resources, then I buy the food from you which I then own and consume. Nor is it wrong to harvest trees and make tires with your labor, then sell me the tires for my car. It becomes wrong when you seek to only \"rent\" me the tires and expect me to keep paying without end under threat of taking the tires away should I stop paying. At some point you have obtained fair value for your effort and you are not legitimately entitled to anything else from me.*\\n\\n&gt; * /u/ImagineAllTheKarma \"How can you have a libertarian system with renting being outlawed? Isn\\'t that against the libertarian principle of property rights?\"\\n\\n&gt; *The same way we ban slavery. We just say there are some types of business transactions that are contrary to our values and we refuse to allow anyone to conduct such business or profit in such a manner. You still own your own home, but you can\\'t own mine and rent it to me, you just have to sell it outright.*\\n\\n\\n(2) **Is the sacrifice of this element of Personal Freedom to Rent your own Property worth it in the face of the benefit to society by establishing more stable and invested Ownership across a larger swath of the populace?**\\n\\n(3) **What are the likely *intended* results and *unintended* consequences of a prohibition on Renting?**\\n\\n&gt; * /u/Tsuruta64: \"So, I rent a room, and let my landlord take care of things - and he knows far more about that stuff than I do. What\\'s the problem?\"\\n\\n&gt; *Room rental might be a valid exception, akin to a hotel/motel. But I would draw the line at owning an entire second house for the exclusive purpose of Renting it.*\\n\\n&gt; * /u/Piediver: \"I saved up and bought an apartment complex which I turned from a miserable dump of a place to happy healthy homes in a traditionally poor sector of town. I am not the 1%. What becomes of my hard work?\"\\n\\n&gt; *Your renters become owners and buy you out. You can still contract for maintenance and earn a tidy sum while living there for no extra payment in a unit you own already.*\\n\\n&gt; * /u/aggie_moose: \"How are the renters going to \\'buy him out\\'...\"\\n\\n&gt; *Their \"rent\" payments they already make become like mortgage paymemts. At some point they fully own the apartment and can stop paying. The former owner is thus compensated fairly for the value of the unit. Apartments basically become condos.*\\n\\n&gt; * /u/Pontifier: \"As someone who owns large amounts of property, and rents it out I actually support this idea... \\nI see that the current situation isn\\'t great for anyone involved. I don\\'t understand how people are even able to pay their rent... Most of the rent people pay us goes toward our mortgages, the rest goes into repairs. All we do is shuffle money around. We don\\'t realy add any value to the system, and I hate it... If you want to change things, look at laws concerning home building. Eliminate restrictions... superfluous requirements and you\\'ll see cheap housing start to appear. You\\'ll put my family business out of business, but everyone will be better off, including me. I\\'ll get a basic income too.\"\\n\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#**Minarchist Libertarian Government**\\n\\nFor the purposes of this discussion, I will give the Wikipedia definition:\\n\\n*\"Minarchism (also known as minimal statism) is a political philosophy. It is variously defined by sources. In the strictest sense, it holds that states ought to exist (as opposed to anarchy), that their only legitimate function is the protection of individuals from aggression, theft, breach of contract, and fraud, and that the only legitimate governmental institutions are the military, police, and courts. In the broadest sense, it also includes fire departments, prisons, the executive, and legislatures as legitimate government functions. Such states are generally called \\'night-watchman\\' states.*\\n\\n*Minarchists argue that the state has no authority to use its monopoly of force to interfere with free transactions between people, and see the state\\'s sole responsibility as ensuring that contracts between private individuals and property are protected, through a system of law courts and enforcement. Minarchists generally believe a laissez-faire approach to the economy is most likely to lead to economic prosperity.\"*\\n\\nThis would mean that some bare minimum of appropriate taxes would still need to be collected to fund the minimum level of government necessary to ensure the above mentioned services, along with a Basic Income. (I consider this a \"necessary evil\".) This also means that the courts would no longer enforce or hold legitimate any Rental agreements (just as one could not sell themselves into \"voluntary slavery\").\\n\\n&gt; * /u/Wriston: \"How is this massive collective control in any way libertarian, less powerful state, /chist ?\"\\n\\n&gt; *By definition, this proposal means 99% of everyone keeps what they already have plus a little more from what the 1% have. 99% of everyone ending up benefiting from this seems like a good idea to me.*\\n\\n&gt; * /u/Trimestrial: \"...No fire department, roads, pollution control, water supply, food inspection, libraries, parks, and other public goods are not part of your government. Are you for real?\"\\n\\n&gt; *A core tenet of Libertarian government is that people will contract with local providers for these services. They will not evaporate forever, just shift to another mode.*\\n\\n&gt; * /u/LeeHyori: \"A government necessarily violates people\\'s rights. So, you can only support it on utilitarian grounds. Morality and justice exist independent of government (this is the natural rights view), so having a government does not follow. Just because there are injustices doesn\\'t mean that the body that must rectify these injustices or deal with them in some way or another has to be a state. It merely demonstrates that an injustice has occurred; nowhere in that does it establish, specifically, the monopolistic political authority of the state. \\n\\n\\n*****\\n\\nI know this is a *HUGE* post with a lot of assertions, but I hope to get some great responses based on the voluminous fodder for discussion.

Maybe I used ineffective search terms. Whatever.\\n\\nI was raised evangelical Christian (Southern Baptist, specifically). All through my life I held Christian viewpoints. I still do, but I am discovering that a lot of the Southern Baptist doctrines are little more than traditions established over the years, and have little to no Biblical basis, or else are based on misinterpretations of scripture.\\n\\nRecently I\\'ve been more and more often pulled into the conflict between the church and gay rights. Now, I\\'ve already made my position clear on gay rights: People shouldn\\'t be discriminated against for their sexual orientation, regardless of how we feel as a religion about their actions; it\\'s between two consenting adults and we don\\'t have a right to legislate that, and as Christians we should treat them with love.\\n\\nFurthermore, as a heterosexual male married to a heterosexual female, I have no personal stake in this. However, I\\'m finding it difficult to reconcile some parts of my worldview with the idea that homosexuality is morally wrong from God\\'s perspective. I have heard some fairly solid arguments each way. In short, I am on the fence and that\\'s not where I like to be. \\n\\nI am aware of the following points regarding homosexuality:\\n\\n1: Something being \"natural\" or \"unnatural\" does not have any bearing upon its morality.\\n\\n2: Homosexuality is overtly condemned in the Old Testament law... along with a lot of other things that modern Christians do not follow due to Christ\\'s example and the release of many of the prohibitions upon Christian gentiles. So OT condemnations don\\'t have any weight unless they come with a convincing argument that the lifting of the limitations doesn\\'t apply to that particular part.\\n\\n3: There are parts of the New Testament that condemn homosexuality, as well.\\n\\nSo, from the perspective of a Christian, Change My View. Either convince me scripturally that homosexuality is wrong, or that it is not condemned. But keep it within the scope of Christian values, please. I\\'m not asking whether it\\'s right or wrong. I\\'m asking whether it\\'s scripturally defensible.\\n\\nEdit: I\\'ve gotten a lot of comments to this effect, so I\\'ll address this specifically: I\\'m not asking whether we should act to retard the process of gay rights in our nation or speak out against non-Christians who participate in homosexuality. In my opinion, the answer to that question is a resounding \"NO.\" As /u/tonsofkittens and a few others have pointed out, Christ\\'s example is more than sufficient to determine our behavior against those who live in sin but are not followers of God.\\n\\nMy real question, then, is is homosexuality sin at all? Does God look down on it? Is it harmful to us the same way other sin is? Does it displease the Creator?\\n\\nBonus points: Is there any defense for homosexuality being okay with God that doesn\\'t abolish the institution of monogamy, or cause promiscuity to be okay? \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

For example, someone is male-bodied and doesn\\'t experience dysphoria, but they play with dolls or like the color pink. This doesn\\'t mean that they\\'re some sort of boy/girl mix; it just means they\\'re a boy who likes dolls. To suggest that men can\\'t perform female gender roles without becoming part girl seems like 1950\\'s type of thinking.

One of the major struggles the trans community faces is getting people to understand that they were born in the \"wrong\" body. It isn\\'t an act they\\'re putting on, and it isn\\'t a choice they made. When a genderfluid person comes in and says \"I\\'m feeling a little feminine, I guess I\\'m a woman today.\" it gives ammunition to the opposition. \\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll admit some ignorance here because I don\\'t personally know anyone who identifies as genderfluid/genderqueer.

Amateur conceal-carriers are going to fair even worse, I\\'d imagine.\\n\\nI agree that guns are a tool like any other, that can be used and misused. I also believe guns are a completely inefficient tool for anything other than combat with intent to kill, and the idea that we need to guns to stop muggers and rapists is a fallacy we use to excuse our love affair with weaponry.\\n\\nObviously we can craft scenarios where a gun is the best possible tool for self defense, but that\\'s just my point: these scenarios are almost always completely unrealistic. Far more efficient options include good aggressive unarmed self defense techniques, conflict avoidance, investing in home security that prevents home invaders from actually entering the building, and options like tasers which can still be misused but are less likely to cause loss of life.\\n\\nCertainly we can\\'t *eliminate* risk. There will always be failures and tragedies, guns or no guns. But guns make wholesale slaughter a lot easier because that\\'s what they\\'re designed for, and the [rebranding](http://kencrow.us/2013/12/11/glocks-pro-gun-and-pro-self-defense-commercial-is-likely-to-offend-your-liberal-friends/) of weaponry as a viable self-defense tool is just irresponsible. I don\\'t hate guns or people who own them, but I think people think guns will protect them, and I think that\\'s a lie.\\n\\nTo change my view, I\\'d like proof that guns are a viable self defense tool. Statistic are often [unreliable](http://kencrow.us/2013/12/11/glocks-pro-gun-and-pro-self-defense-commercial-is-likely-to-offend-your-liberal-friends/) on this topic due to the highly political nature of the argument, but I\\'ll accept any strong logical arguments.\\n\\n**EDIT**: This has been a fantastic discussion. I\\'ve got a lot of research to do. I\\'ve awarded two deltas: one to /u/forealdudes for informing me that my notions about the 21 foot rule are incorrect and that according to military training the man with the firearm will still frequently maintain control of the situation even if the attacker is very close, and another to the appropriately named /u/Gun_Defender for providing a CDC article I won\\'t pretend to be qualified to disagree with that specifically states crime victims who defended themselves with guns fared better than those who used other methods.\\n\\nI still maintain two beliefs: one, that people massively overvalue guns as self defense tools such that they neglect other forms of training. Self-defense requires a well rounded regimen, putting all of your faith in one tool is lazy and oftentimes dangerous. And two, that we as a culture all suffer from the misinformation surrounding guns. The fact that guns might be useful as a crime deterrent does not mean we shouldn\\'t be extremely skeptical of the people who shill them or the culture they create.\\n\\nBut overall I think my original V is C\\'d. By all means keep the discussion going. I\\'ll be checking back in to see if anyone else has raised some good points.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

       "'I can\\'t remember the topic that spurred this discussion, but a friend and I were debating whether man-made things were natural. He took the position that they are unnatural. \\n\\nHe cited this definition by Merriam-Webster:  existing in nature and not made or caused by people : coming from nature (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural) as his basis for the distinction for natural vs. unnatural.\\n\\nHowever, I respectfully disagree with his position and furthermore that definition of natural. People arise from nature. Humankind\\'s capacity to create, problem-solve, analyze, rationalize, and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural? It is only through natural occurrences that we have this ability, why is it that we would give the credit of these things solely to man, as opposed to nature? We are not separate from nature, thus, how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature, I would understand the distinction between natural and man-made. However, I think unnatural and man-made are not synonyms by any means. It seems to me that man-made things MUST be natural due to our being part of nature. \\n\\nI would love to hear your arguments and to have my view changed if I am mistaken in my logic somewhere along the line.\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for your responses lads. As many of you pointed out, our argument depends more on the context of the use of the word and I think that my friend and I were arguing about the semantics and definition more than our intended meaning behind use of the word \"natural\".'"

When an environmentalist says that unnatural toxins are damaging the environment, what she means is not necessarily just that toxins are artificial, but that by producing them we are somehow upsetting the course of the universe. Similarly, when a fundamentalist says that homosexuality is \"unnatural,\" he does not just mean that it is artificial in the sense of being created by society- he means that it is somehow wrong that this is a social artifact of humanity. \\n\\nI think what you mean to object to is \"natural\" in this sense of the word, which is perfectly reasonable.
